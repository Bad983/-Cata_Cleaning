“To violate such a pledge does not constitute sin, 

since everyone knows, according to the Decretals,

that if a man vows to commit a crime, 

and then abstains from doing it, it is not perjury.

You say to me that you have sworn allegiance 

to this god, who has guided you to such a point 

that you eat all foods without salt, 

so has he made you lose the sense of taste.

And so he has people call him the God of Love, 

but whoever calls him this makes a great mistake, 

for his proper name is Pain.

Now separate yourself from him, or you will die, 

and no longer keep him as your lord, 

and take the good advice I am giving you!”
