I said to her: “My Lady, I give thanks to you 

when you deigned to accept them; 

you comforted me so much 

that I can hardly expect to have greater joy;

and if I ever have it, I know I have it thanks to you.

Thus, I am content, even if you were to pawn or sell 

either the gift you received from me 

or my very person; I will never dispute with you."

She said to me: “Many thanks. 

And I tell you to do the same with me, 

for I love you properly, honorably and faithfully”

I did not refuse her things; 

but often what fools believe does not come to pass: 

thus it happened to the good Ser Durante.
