Modesty bows her head toward the ground, 

for she knew that she had made a mistake, 

and covered her face with a large veil. 

And in this way she spoke to her cousin, Fear:

“Fear, we find ourselves hated 

by Jealousy, and this has been done to us 

by Resistance, because he was courteous 

to that handsome lad whom I saw yesterday morning.

Now let’s go quickly to find that uncouth one, 

and we’ll tell him how badly he’ll be treated, 

if Jealousy gets her hands on him;

for he has not kept guard the way he should have, 

since he should be hostile to everyone; 

but the devil has now made him so refined!”
