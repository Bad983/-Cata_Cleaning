“My Lady, I bring you many greetings 

from your son, who begs you, in the name of God, 

that you help him, or else he is in serious trouble, 

because Jealousy is giving him many problems.

A short while ago he was almost killed 

in a battle, in which I too took part. 

My face still clearly shows 

that I was in the thick of battle.”

Then Venus became enraged 

and said that very soon 

she will set the fortress on fire;

and despite the efforts of Jealousy, 

the fortress will be destroyed: 

no guard whatsoever will be able to save it.
