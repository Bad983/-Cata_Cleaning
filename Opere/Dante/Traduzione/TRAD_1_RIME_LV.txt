Alas, by the violence of the many sighs born of the thoughts in my heart, my eyes are worn out and lack strength to return the gaze of any who might look at them. And they are become such that they seem two desires to shed tears and show sorrow; and often they weep so much that Love circles them with a crown of suffering.

These thoughts and the sighs I heave have become so oppressive in my heart that Love faints away there, it so grieves him; because they, the sorrowing ones, have in them that sweet name of my lady written, and many words concerning her death.
