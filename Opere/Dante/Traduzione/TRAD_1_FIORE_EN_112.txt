“As long as Christ went throughout the world, 

his disciples did not ask 

for bread or wine, but earned it 

with their hands, if the Scripture does not lie.

I fought over this with the good masters of theology 

because they preached this sermon 

to the people of Paris and backed it up with proof:

that the man who lives on alms is in the devil’s clutches.

Moreover, after Jesus returned to heaven, 

Saint Paul exhorted his companions 

not to profit from the Gospel.

And so, without reward, they preached their sermons; 

they lived from their work, and this I don’t conceal from you, 

without building castles or palaces.”
