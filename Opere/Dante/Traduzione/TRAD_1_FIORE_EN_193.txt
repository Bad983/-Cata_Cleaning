“If I had been, for my sake, 

very wise and intelligent in my youth, 

when I was still so beautiful and pleasing 

that news of me went everywhere,

I would be very rich, believe me; 

but I gave everything to that wretch, 

who was not smart enough to do wise things, 

and he spent it all in debauchery.

He didn’t like to save anything, 

but drank and gambled it all away, 

so singularly predisposed was he to vice;

so in the end I had to leave him, 

when I no longer had anything to give him; 

he took wealth away from me and from himself.”
