“On the other hand, women are born free: 

the law takes away from them their free state,

where Nature through her generosity 

put them as soon as they were created.

Now the law has so bound them 

and put them in such distress 

that they all willingly strive 

to return to this state of freedom.

You see how the wild bird, when it’s in a cage, 

will sing with all its heart – this will be clear to you – 

­but it does not like the food it has;

for Nature has instilled such freedom in it 

that day and night it seeks feverishly to escape, 

although it has enough millet or wheat or rice.”
