“Many times that scoundrel said to me, 

the one for whom I had so much pain and ill, 

that such a time would arrive 

when I would feel both cold and heat.

He certainly told the truth; that debt I’ve truly paid; 

but, so much and so intense was the pleasure I enjoyed, 

that my heart leaps up in me 

when I remember, and then becomes happy once again.

A young woman is never idle, 

if she considers carefully the matter 

of how she may lead a joyful life,

except that she should think to fill her larder, 

so that she may never find herself in need, 

when old age comes and attacks her.”
