“Since it is your pleasure, I’ll tell you all you want,”

False Seeming said then. “Now listen, 

for I’ll tell you the truth 

about the place I frequent and where I stay.

Sometimes I mix with the laity, 

but I flee to the cloisters for safety, 

for there I can be a great mocker 

and will always be regarded as a saint.

Lay brothers’ work is way too open: 

I don’t need to associate with them a lot, 

for I have to play my game in great secrecy.

In order to hide my wickedness, 

I don the habit of the good brother Albert.

Whoever wears that garb never fears shame.”
