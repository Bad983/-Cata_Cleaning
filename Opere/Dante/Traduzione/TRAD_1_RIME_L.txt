There had come into my heart the gentle lady who for her perfection was placed by the most high Lord in the heaven of humility where Mary is.

There had come into my mind that gentle lady mourned by Love, at the very moment when her perfection drew you to look at what I was doing. Love, feeling her in my mind, had awoken in my ravaged heart, and said to my sighs, ‘Go forth’; so each one went off sorrowing.

Lamenting they left my breast, with a voice that often brings tears to my sad eyes. But those that issued with most pain were those that came out saying: ’ noble mind, it is a year today since you went up to heaven.’
