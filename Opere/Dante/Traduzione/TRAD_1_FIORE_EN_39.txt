“It is not my intention to keep you from loving,” 

said Reason, “nor do I want to discourage you from it, 

for I want you to love dearly the whole world, 

reinforcing your belief in Jesus Christ.

And if you give your love to someone, 

I don’t want you to love her only for pleasure 

or for delight, but to draw fruit from the relationship, 

because whoever wishes a different end falls into sin.

It’s true that there is great delight in that act, 

which Nature put there as a lure, 

in order for men to go to bed with women more often.

And if it were not so, we well know 

that few people would engage 

in the labor that Adam first began.”
