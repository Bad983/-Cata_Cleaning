“Nowadays all men go around cursing women, 

and each one plots to deceive them: 

and thus each one of us must devise ways 

to have Wealth banish them from her realm.

And we must not put our heart 

only in one place, but think 

of ways to ensnare them 

and take away all their wealth.

A woman must have many lovers, 

and from each of them she must get what’s coming to her 

and do it in such a way that they’re taken for fools;

she must make them sell their tower and palace, 

or home or farm or even their cultivated lands, 

so that they all live in great discomfort.”
