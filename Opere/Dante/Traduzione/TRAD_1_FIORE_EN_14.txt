Mercy then began her speech 

with tears streaming down her face, 

saying: “Resistance, you would commit a great offence 

if you were not to grant my request.

I beg you that you may find it in your heart

to not be so cruel toward that young vassal, 

who is so good and wise, 

for you know that he does not have bad intentions.

Now, we have told you our concerns,

and the reason why we have come: 

cruel is he who will not do what we ask!

The poor fellow whom you delighted in abandoning 

sends you many greetings: 

may our prayers help him in this time of need!”
