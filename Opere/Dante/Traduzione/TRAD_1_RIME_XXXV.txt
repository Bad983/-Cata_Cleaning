My lady bears Love in her eyes, so that she ennobles all she looks at. Wherever she goes everyone turns towards her, and when she greets someone she makes his heart tremble, so that, lowering his eyes, he turns all pale and sighs over all his faults. Pride and ill humour fly before her. Help me, ladies, to do her honour.

All gentleness, every humble thought is born in the heart of all who hear her speak; and so he who first sees her is praised. What she seems when she smiles a little can neither be described nor held before the mind; it is a marvel so rare and perfect.
