Forced Abstinence came forward

and said: “He comes as my companion, 

because without him, I could not provide for myself, 

no matter how much I might pray to God and the Saints.

He governs himself and me according to the ways 

his mother Hypocrisy taught him. 

I wear the mantle of hypocrisy 

in order to gain my rewards more quickly.

And thus we look after each other 

and lead a happy life, 

without ever saying what we really think.

Our appearance seems very pious, 

but there’s no evil act that we don’t conceive, 

although we appear to be religious folk.”
