“See how much money the usurers, 
seneschals, provosts and mayors have! 
All of them are big swindlers, 
and they are very proud and fierce.
Moreover, all of the bourgeoisie, to the detriment of the 
knights, now sell their own goods 
at inflated prices and on credit,
so that every nobleman will be robbed.
They must sell their house and land 
so that the bourgeoisie can be paid, 
they who day and night keep the nobles in tight straits.
But I, who clothe myself in various garbs, 
make each of them believe the other’s wrong, 
and I deceive both the deceivers and the deceived.”
