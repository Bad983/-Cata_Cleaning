On seeing that the castle was complete, 

Jealousy had it stocked with arms, 

for she did not wish to surrender it 

either through battle or treaty.

In order to give her enemies a bad reception 

she placed inside a great store of projectiles, 

and tar and oil and everything else 

that would ignite a war machine or battering ram,

if any one of these would approach too close. 

For many castles have been lost 

by those who failed to note their enemiesâ€™ ploys.

Jealousy had still other weapons made, 

such as catapults that would keep the enemies far away 

by pelting them with stones and darts.
