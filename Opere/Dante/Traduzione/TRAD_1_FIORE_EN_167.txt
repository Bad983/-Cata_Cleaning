“I hear that, in order not to fail 

to take the sheep or ram, the she-wolf, 

when she thinks it’s time to eat, 

attacks more than a hundred to get just one.

In this way, the woman must get prepared, 

if she had any sense at all: 

against them all she must raise her flag 

to make them fall into her net.

Since she doesn’t know who’ll be caught 

until she’s clipped their wing, 

she must always keep her net stretched out,

and capture them in the folds and hems of her dress. 

But if she learned or heard 

that he was poor, then let her throw him down the stairs.”
