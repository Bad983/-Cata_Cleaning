The face of that image was very well-fashioned 

and had an exceedingly noble appearance; 

My only thought was to go there in procession 

and to complete my pilgrimage there.

And it would not have seemed to me too much

to kneel before it for an entire day 

and then at night to lie prostrate before it, 

and to make a great offering in addition.

For I was sure that, if I were able to touch 

the relics that were kept below the image, 

my every ill would be healed;

and if I suffered from headaches, or back pains,

or any other grievous sickness, 

these relics would give me relief from all of them.
