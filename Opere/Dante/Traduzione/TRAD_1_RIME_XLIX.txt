Alas, whenever I remember that I must never again see the lady on whose account I grieve, sorrowing memory brings such pain around my heart that I say: ‘My soul, why do you not depart? For the suffering you will have to bear in this world ‑already so tedious to you- ­greatly oppresses my thoughts with fear.’ So I call upon Death, as my dear and sweet repose, and say: ‘Come to me’, with so much love that I am bitterly envious of all who die.
My sighs gather together into a pitiful sound that calls continually on Death, to whom all my desires turned once my lady was seized by his harsh power. For the loveliness of her beauty, when it withdrew from our sight, became a great spiritual beauty that now spreads a light of love through heaven, a light that gives joy to the angels and rouses wonder in their high subtle intellects, so noble is it in that place!
