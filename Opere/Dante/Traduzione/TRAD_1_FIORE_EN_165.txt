“Now I want to speak with you about your wardrobe, 

about how each woman must be well dressed 

and how through no fault of her own 

she should not be left without proper adornment.

Let her goal be to make herself beautiful; 

but, before she shows herself to her friends, 

she must look closely in the mirror 

to be sure she has no blemish.

And when she leaves her house 

by night or day she should go elegantly: 

she should not walk too erectly or too bent over,

so that she may please those who gaze at her; 

and if her dress touches the ground, 

she should lift it a bit, and will be thus more pleasing.”
