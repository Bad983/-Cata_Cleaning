The Old Woman then said: “My friend, 

this is the news I bring you: 

Fair Welcome sends you greetings 

and encouragement, so help me Almighty God.

Thus, I say to you that I believe 

your ship will arrive in such a port 

that you will pluck the Flower in the garden.”

These are the words that healed me.

“Now I’ll tell you, my friend, what you’ll do: 

you will come very quietly 

to the gate that opens to the garden;

and I will go along the straight road 

and make sure you’ll find the gate open, 

so that you will have the Flower in your possession.”
