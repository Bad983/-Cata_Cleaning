If you who read me are friend Lippo, then, before you consider the words I promise to say, I place myself in your keeping with such greeting as you like best, on behalf of him who has written me for you. I beg you, as a gentleman, to hear me; and while you hear, to invite your mind too and intelligence to listen. A humble sonnet I call myself, and I come right into your sight to prevent you ignoring me.

I bring you this naked maiden who is following me all timidly and who dares not walk abroad, for she has no clothes to cover her: and I beg the gentle heart that dwells in you to clothe her and keep her as your friend; so that she may become known and be able to go wherever she pleases.
