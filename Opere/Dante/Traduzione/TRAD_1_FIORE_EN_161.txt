“With much effort a woman can get 

ahead of these faithless people. 

Dido could not keep Aeneas 

from running away from her,

and she had put so much effort into serving him.

And what did Jason do with Medea?

Through all the enchantments she knew 

she was able to protect him from death,

and then he left her, that unfaithful one.

For which reason, she killed the children 

she had with him, and did other evil things;

but so great was her love 

that she abandoned all of her maternal compassion 

to make that one suffer who had pleased her so much.”
