Modesty then took her sword in hand 

and advances toward Delight. 

Immediately she held the shield close to her breast 

and said: “May it go as it must go,

for either I’ll make you leave the field, 

or you’ll make your bed on the ground.”

Then she strikes him with great anger, 

as one intent on killing him;

she sent him sprawling on the ground 

and would have split him to his teeth; 

but when Well-Hidden had seen this,

since they were close relatives, 

he immediately went to his aid. 

Modesty said: “I’ll make both of you sorry.”
