Full of meekness I turned back 

towards the garden, as Friend had said I should, 

and I looked and so I saw 

Resistance, with a large club made of pine,

who was blocking off every passageway, 

so that I could not go inside. 

Thus, I approached and greeted him 

meekly with my head bowed down,

and said to him: “Resistance, have mercy 

on me, if I have done you any wrong, 

for I have come in good faith

to ask your mercy, and am ready to make amends.”

He stares at me and, as he does, tries to determine 

if I’m saying this to deceive him.
