Jealousy had a castle built 

with large moats and fortifications all around, 

because she greatly feared outsiders, 

just as much as she did those within her castle.

And in the middle she had the greatest craftsmen 

construct an impressive tower 

with finely chiseled marble,

which feared no assault from uncouth men.

She then had four portals made 

that were surmounted with lofty crenelated towers: 

never had the world seen anything like them.

She ordered movable gates 

that opened and closed hydraulically; 

the other gates were all reinforced with iron.
