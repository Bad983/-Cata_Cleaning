“Always behave the way she does: 

if she laughs, you laugh, or if she dances, you dance; 

and if she cries, attempt to console her, 

but make sure that you cry without delay.

And if she should be playing a game of ball 

with other women, and the ball 

should go far away, run and bring it back to her: 

always think and work to serve her.

And if the time comes when she argues with you, 

or when she angers you so much that you strike her, 

immediately return to obey her,

and swear to her that you’ll never do it again; 

you will do penance for what you did. 

Grab her and do to her what you do best!”
