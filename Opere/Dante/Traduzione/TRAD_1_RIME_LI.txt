My eyes saw what pity was in your face as you looked at the bearing and aspect that I often show in my grief. Then I understood that you were pondering on this sad life of mine, so that a fear seized my heart of showing my weakness through my eyes.

And I withdrew from your presence, feeling the tears welling from my heart that was stirred by the sight of you. Then in my sad soul I said: ‘The same Love who makes me go thus weeping is certainly with that lady.’
