Who will ever look without fear into the eyes of this lovely girl, the eyes which have reduced me to such a state that now I expect only death, a bitter death? See how hard is my plight -­for my life was chosen from all others to serve as an example to men not to dare take the risk of gazing at her face.

Such an end was my destiny, since one man had to be destroyed that others might be saved from danger; and this, alas, is why I was as prompt in drawing to myself life's contrary as a pearl is to draw in the influence of a star.
