“I don’t want you to give up your pleasure,” 
said Reason, “nor for you to be without a lover, 
but I want you to take me for your lady; 
for you will not find anywhere
a woman more beautiful than I
or one who will give you more pleasure. 
I would be worthy to be the Queen of France;
thus, you would be foolish to toss me aside,
for I will make you richer than Wealth herself, 
without concern that the wheel of Fortune 
may put you in a sorry state.
If you look at me clearly, you will not find in me any 
feature that is not the best of every beauty; 
I am more radiant than the sun and the moon.”
