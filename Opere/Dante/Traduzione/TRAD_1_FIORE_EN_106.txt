“And thus you go about preaching poverty 

and you praise her.” “It’s true that, to benefit others, 

I am not now, nor ever was, her friend; 

in fact, I bear her fierce animosity,

for I would prefer the friendship 

of the King of France to that of one 

who goes begging from door to door 

and often dies of want.

And no matter how saintly a soul a poor man 

might have, I don’t like to associate with him, 

and, as much as I can, I put him off in a corner;

and if I show him affection, it’s all feigned. 

But I must cover myself with that mantle:

to show that I am good, I give them attention.”
