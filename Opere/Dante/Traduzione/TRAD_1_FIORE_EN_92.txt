“Those with whom I pass my time have so firmly 

ensnared the world beneath their feet 

that there is no great prelate 

who can set limits to their power.

With my trickery I sink each one of them, 

and if an important man of letters comes along 

who wants to show my sin for what it is, 

I can confound him with the powers I have.

Master Siger did not meet a happy end:

with a sword I made him die with great pain 

in the court of Rome, at Orvieto.

As for Master William, the good man of Saint-Amour,

I had the prohibition placed on him in France 

and had him exiled from the realm with great outcry.”
