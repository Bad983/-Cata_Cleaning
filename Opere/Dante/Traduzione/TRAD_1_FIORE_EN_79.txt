Lady Leisure was in the first line 

with Noble Heart and with Wealth; 

Sincerity, Courtesy, Mercy, Generosity, 

Boldness and Honor, all of them were there.

Delight and Social Grace followed in the company; 

Angel-Like, Safety, and Happiness 

and Joy and Beauty and Youth 

were all following the banner.

Then came Humility and Patience; 

Joyfulness was there and Well-Hidden 

and False Seeming and Forced Abstinence.

Love was astonished 

to see False Seeming in his presence, 

and said: “Who’s vouched for him?”
