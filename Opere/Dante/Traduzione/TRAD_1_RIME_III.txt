Your assured, elegant, dignified speech bears good witness to the good that men say of you: indeed it does more, so that everyone would be hard put to it to recite your praises completely ‑no words would be adequate to recount them, your merit has soared so high. Hence I say that whoever thinks he justly praises you in fact speaks ill of you.
You say that to love unloved is the worst of love's pains. Yet many say there is a still greater pain. So I beg you, if you don't mind, in your wisdom, please, to throw yet more light on the matter, showing me whether or no experience declares the truth of it.
Although I don't know your name or birthplace ‑you, my friend, who write to me‑ yet I know well that he has famous knowledge, such that no one I know has so much. For one can easily recognize from his conversation whether a man is intelligent ‑that's where it shows! Since I have to praise you without naming you, my tongue is in difficulties, as it speaks of this.
Know, my friend (and I am certain of this, as one who has loved with real love) that he who loves unloved has the greatest pain; for this pain holds sway over all others and is called the chief one: it is the source of all the suffering that love brings.
