“After this I want you to refrain 

from going often to the castle, 

and do not show that you like 

to gaze at the place where Fair Welcome resides.

For you must be very careful, 

as long as Bad Mouth is hostile towards you, 

since you know that he is a terrible person 

who screams and shouts and argues day and night.

You don’t have to be as careful with the other guards 

as you do with Bad Mouth, 

for they would gladly stay off to one side;

but that Norman immediately shoots off his mouth 

about everything he knows, both in the squares and in the churches; 

he concocts his tales and readies them for delivery.”
