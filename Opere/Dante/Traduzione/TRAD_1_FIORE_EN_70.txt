“Since it suits my purpose to act treacherously, 

and you think, Friend, that I should, 

I will do so, even though I find it unpleasant, 

in order to overcome that ugly watch-dog.

But I beg you, noble companion, 

if you know a quicker route 

to chase away Bad Mouth and all his associates

and to release Fair Welcome from prison,

show it to me, and I will go that way 

and take with me such powerful help 

that I’ll bring that fortress down.”

“I have just returned from there,”

answered Friend, “but I’ll tell you the truth, 

that as sure as I went that way, I have regretted it.”
