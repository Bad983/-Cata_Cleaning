Sincerity left the army of the barons, 

and Love gave her instructions 

to tell his mother all about his current state – 

how his life is in great danger,

and how his strength is greatly diminished –

and to do what she can to help him. 

Then Sincerity rode off 

and went straight to Mount Cecerone, 

believing that the goddess would be there; 

but she had gone into the woods to hunt; 

and so Sincerity went directly to her.

She found her resting in the shade of an oak tree. 

Sincerity quickly kneeled before her 

and greeted her courteously.
