The sorrowful love that leads me to final death, at the will of her who used to keep my heart in joy, has withdrawn the light and daily withdraws it more ‑the light that once my eyes received from a star such that I never thought I would be sad on its account. And the wound I had from it I have kept concealed, but now it shows itself through excessive pain -­pain caused by that fire which has drawn me away from happiness, so that now I can expect nothing but torment: and my life ‑which cannot last long now‑ sighs as it goes to death, and says: ‘Through her I die, whose name is Beatrice.’
That sweet name which embitters my heart will renew all the pain I feel whenever I see it written; and through sorrow I'll become so wasted in body and woeful in face that any who see me will be struck with fear: and the least breath of wind will sweep me along, until I fall down cold; and so I shall die, and my sorrow will be accompanied by my soul on her sad departure, and will evermore remain closely united with her, while she remembers the joy of the sweet face to which Paradise seems nothing in comparison.
Reflecting on my experience of Love, my soul desires no other joy and gives no thought to the torment that she expects; for once the body is worn out, the love that has so gripped me will depart with my soul to Him who hears each man's account; and should He not pardon her sins, she will depart with the torment that she has deserved; but in such a way that she will feel no terror of it -being so absorbed in contemplating the image of her who was the cause of her journey, that whatever her punishment may be she will not feel it. Thus if I have been a loser in this world, Love will recompense me in the other.
Death, you who do the will of this lady, for pity's sake, before you destroy me, go to her, make her tell you why the light of those eyes that make me suffer has been withdrawn from me so. If another is receiving it, let me know; deliver me from illusion and I shall die with far less sorrow.

Congedo.
