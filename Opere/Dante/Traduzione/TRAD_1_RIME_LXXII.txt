Anyone who heard the coughing of the luckless wife of Bicci (called Forese) might say that maybe she'd passed the winter in the land where crystal is made. You'll find her frozen in mid-August-so guess how she must fare in any other month! And it's no use her keeping her stockings on-the bedclothes are too short ....

The coughing and cold and other troubles-these don't come to her from ageing humours, but from the gap she feels in the nest. Her mother, who has more than one affliction, weeps saying: ‘Alas, for dried figs I could have married her to Count Guido!’ 



The other night I had a great fit of coughing, because I'd nothing to put over me; but as soon as day came I went off to look for money, wherever it might be found. Hear where luck led me! For I thought I'd find pearls in a wooden box and fine coined florins of red gold, but I found Alighieri among the graves, tied by some knot -I don't know if the one called Solomon's, or some other sage's. Then I made the sign of the cross facing east. And he said to me: ‘For the love of Dante, release me.’ But I couldn't see how-so turned back and came home.
