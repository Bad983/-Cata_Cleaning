Everyone was looking for Resistance 

to blame him for his bad mistake; 

and that one had made himself a bed 

from a bundle of grass, and there he fell asleep.

Modesty was reprimanding him very harshly; 

in her turn Fear assails him, 

saying: “Resistance, you don’t care at all 

that Jealousy is so upset with us!

And this happens to us because of you, it’s clear. 

Whenever you, for your misfortune, 

wish to seem or to be courteous

you well know that it’s not your nature!, 

you must be, as we all are, on the defensive, 

in order to protect this enclosed place of ours.”
