Into your hands, my gentle lady, I commend my dying spirit: it goes on its way so sadly that Love himself, who sends it away, regards it with pity. You bound it subject to his dominion, so that from that moment it was power­less to invoke him save in these words: ‘Lord, whatever be your will in my regard, that is my will also.’
