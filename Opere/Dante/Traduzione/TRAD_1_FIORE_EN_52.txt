“Serve and honor with all your might 

the Old Woman who guards Fair Welcome; 

if she wishes, she can be very useful to you, 

because she is neither silly nor foolish.

With Jealousy - may an evil fire burn her! -

do the same, if you succeed in seeing her. 

Promise all of them generous compensation, 

but delay payment as much as possible.

And if you give gifts, give jewels, 

beautiful hats and bonnets and silk ribbons 

and beautiful garlands and pins,

and ivory combs and barrettes, 

knives and rosaries and cloths; 

for these are inexpensive gifts.”
