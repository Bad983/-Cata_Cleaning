“I failed to set wealth aside, oh wretched, sorry me, 

for what I took from one, I gave to another; 

as money came in, so it went out; 

I made no effort to save any of it.

I was used to taking gifts from every man, 

and all of these I gave to a scoundrel, 

who called me a common whore 

and would frequently beat me.

He was the one I loved the most, 

and I would call the others ‘sweet friends,’

but he was the only one I loved,

and he would quickly make up 

with me, although he’d beaten me up, 

for he screwed me most sweetly.”
