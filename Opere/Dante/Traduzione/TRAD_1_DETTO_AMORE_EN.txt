Love so decrees, and deems it proper, 
that I should speak in this particular way 
and compose a detto,
so that it may be proclaimed everywhere 
how well I served him. 
Since he took me in his service 
and I made my pledge to him, 
I have held him as my lord 
and will do so forever. 
And this will be a perfect example 
for every lover, 
so that Love will not 
be bitter to him in the end,
but rather that Love will let him have 
the object of his desire, 
which is more valuable than anything else. 
And he is so courteous 
that if someone appears before him humbly
or in a position of supplication,
he will help that one obtain 
whatever he desires 
and will take all his displeasure away. 
Love desires no payment, 
but he does require this pledge: 
that your heart be faithful to him. 
Then he says: “I grant you 
all that you ask 
without your sending any gifts.”
And immediately he gives you a gift 
without there being any gifts 
of fine silver and gold, 
for which reason I worship him 
as a devout lover.
To him I give thanks, for I love 
that lady who is so well endowed 
with every good quality 
that her equal cannot be found; 
and when she appears before me, 
she gives me such great joy 
that my heart gives itself over 
to serving her constantly, 
and I want to become her servant 
for so much pleasure is in her. 
I don’t know if she wants 
me to serve her:
at least she can say she has a servant, 
although I am of little worth. 
Love refuses no one, 
but desires and loves all those 
who eagerly fall in love,
and esteems those 
who strive to please him 
and are completely subservient. 
Love is always 
completely willing to help 
a perfect lover who’s willing to serve. 
Thus, he gives his bounty 
to the one who does not abandon love 
and puts much effort and desire 
into doing such penance 
as Love imposes 
on the one who trusts him; 
and if one bears the penance gladly, 
Love puts this one in a high place 
with respect to the object of his desire: 
May such a day dawn for me! 
For this reason I do not despair, 
but every day hope
for favors, since, in his torture chamber, 
I am without pain 
and am bound there so securely 
that I do not wish a papal legate 
to ever loose my bonds: 
if others may profit from it, let them be loosed! 
For I wish to be bound to Love 
no matter what Reason may allege; 
Love protects my heart from her, 
and it is no longer concerned with her; 
she declares herself a goddess, 
but she never was nor ever will be one. 
Reason censures and disparages Love 
and says that he’s dishonorable, 
but certainly not with me:
because from her I know for sure 
that anyone can be defeated; 
she attacks Love as best she knows how. 
And she says to me: “Foolish one, 
why do you strive so foolishly 
to have such a lordship? 
I mean that whoever 
bears his seal has a terrible lord. 
For myself I do not put my seal 
on any paper that bears his stamp, 
for happiness is too short and fleeting, 
and unpleasantness much too long. 
Now cut your bonds and go far away 
from him, for Love’s nature is such that, 
he shuns the one who gets away from him, 
and goes the other way. 
Thus, do not follow his path, 
if you want to escape from him; 
otherwise you are plowing a bad field
in which good grain will not grow; 
indeed, whoever sows there 
will lose his seed. 
For God’s sake, get away 
from that false pleasure, 
and let my pleasure be yours, 
for it is perfect 
and gives unending joy. 
The god in whom you put your faith 
will give you no guarantees, 
except those that Fortune gives. 
You will be in a great storm, 
if you do not find a safe harbor 
according to what I’ve told you, 
and if you don’t cling to me 
and learn from what I’ve said. 
Now answer me and speak, 
for there’s still a lot of time 
for you to give me your answer; 
but don’t simply reject 
what I’ve proposed. 
Tell me if I’ve framed the problem well.”
And, after I had heard
Reason, who was intent
upon leading me away from the rule
of Love, who rules the world,
I said to her: “Reason,
I have a sound arrangement
with Love, and we are very happy
with our agreement,
and it’s written in my ledger
that I’m no longer indebted to you.
That account is closed;
for which reason I do - and did - consider you
to be all washed up, as these matters go,
ever since I made my pact 
with Love, to whom may God extend a hand, 
and may he always keep me safe and sound. 
You want to keep me from loving 
and you say that Love is bitter, 
but I have found him sweet and perfect, 
and I liked and will like 
his beginning and end, 
because in him there is great pleasure. 
Now, how could I live? 
Whoever lives in the world 
lives badly without Love: 
without Love he is bereft 
of every good virtue, 
and he cannot perform good deeds; 
without Love there is unpleasantness 
who entices the one who dwells with her
to go straight to the place 
where Envy has her home. 
Therefore, I don’t believe you, 
even if you were to say the Creed 
and the Our Father, and the Hail Mary, 
for so little wisdom is in you. 
Goodbye, for I am leaving, 
and I will return to being a perfect lover 
in order to compose another part
to describe how well proportioned she is, 
both in her body and in her members, 
just as I remember them.”
Her fine head of hair 
seems fashioned of gold, 
golden strands that conquered me, 
and with these I’ll begin.
Her lovely face 
does not resemble wax; 
indeed, it is so radiant and beautiful 
that my heart takes satisfaction 
in never comparing it to others, 
such a lovely thing it is. 
Her forehead and her eyebrows surpass 
the beauty of every other woman:
they are so perfectly arched 
that they have turned my thoughts 
toward her, who gives me 
with her sweet look 
more happiness than any jewel. 
No one on whom she gazes 
is concerned about any sickness,
so lovely is her countenance. 
The pupils of her eyes are so brilliant 
that they take away the sun’s light 
and darken and eclipse it 
just as the sun does to the moon. 
For this reason I’ve put 
all my hope in that star, 
and since I live so well with her, 
I desire no other earthly realm. 
Her mouth and nose and chin 
are more beautiful -and I don’t lie- 
than those that Helen had;
and her breath is more fragrant 
than any panther.
For this reason I have, in good faith, 
moved toward her net
and have stumbled into it; 
and thus it’s happened 
that I’ve been so firmly ensnared there 
that never, by my own choice, 
will I leave it. 
Her throat and her breast 
are so resplendent that 
I seem to be in God’s presence 
on that day in which I look upon that goddess. 
So white and creamy is she 
that no creature has ever been 
born who is as worthy as she. 
She is most precious to me, 
for she guided me 
to make a full study of the law 
that Love follows in his court, 
where there are no useless laws. 
Her hands and arms are slender, 
and whoever embraces her 
never suffers any ill, 
no kidney disease, no gout: 
her noble condition 
puts everyone who gazes at her 
in a blissful state. 
For this reason my heart gazes 
on her day and night, 
and with thoughts of her I always greet the dawn, 
because Love has willed it so, 
nor has my heart asked 
if this could come to an end, 
for it would want to love endlessly. 
And when she goes along the street, 
everyone desires her 
for her noble movement;
and when she speaks with someone, 
she speaks so sweetly 
that it seems to be an angel’s voice. 
Her dancing and singing 
are more enchanting than those 
of any siren,
for they calm the atmosphere. 
When she begins to speak 
every cloud leaves the sky, 
and the air remains crystal clear. 
For this reason my heart is so faithful 
that it will never seek to exchange her 
for another at any rate: 
for she is of such worth 
that I could never find any 
treasure that would be equal to her. 
Love, so help me God, 
would consider it madness, 
and I would indeed be foolish or wicked 
if I were to consider this at all. 
But Love has so precisely 
painted her in my mind 
that, no matter if I sleep or am awake, 
I see her painted in my heart.
Never was an assassin 
so willingly disposed to the Old Man,
nor Prester John to God, 
as I am to serve for love 
because of the many virtues she possesses.
And if find pity in her 
or if I am granted 
a little portion of her love, 
I will be happier, 
because of her great worth, 
than if I were to possess Valencia.
If Jealousy has in herself the ability 
to take her away from me, 
then the God of Love is lying to me. 
For I remember well 
what pleasure he offered me, 
provided that I would serve him faithfully. 
To be sure there is a shorter 
way, but I do not take it, 
for which I have no profit, 
since I could enter only one 
step through that door. 
Guarding the passage is Riches, 
who does not look kindly 
on those who do not hold her dear. 
And yet I was so wise 
that I made an attempt 
to see if I could go beyond. 
“You are wasting your time,”
she said to me with a harsh look. 
“You aren’t known to me, 
and for this reason I forbid your passage. 
It’s not because you’re old, 
but because you’ve never made my acquaintance, 
and, in fact, you resist me, 
and I am hostile to anyone 
who avoids me. 
Go on your way, and do the best you can, 
for this I know well: the able hunter 
will certainly catch his prey. 
If you do it so that Venus declares
war on Jealousy, 
the latter, even though she’s cold, 
will have to surrender, 
and your lady will reward you
for your service 
without any cost to you. 
But keep this in mind: 
if one day you wish to deal with me 
be sure to bring gold and silver; 
I will open the door for you 
without your waging war. 
And so you will be welcomed 
by the evil Folle Larghezza
who will loosen the purse strings 
and will lay in great supplies 
of salt and pantry items 
and clothes and wines. 
Poverty is her servant: 
She’ll rob you 
and take your clothes, 
including your nice trousers 
that you’ll never wear again, 
and your shirt and undergarments, 
if you get involved with her. 
She was the daughter of Cuor Fallito:
for God’s sake, be sure that 
what I’ve told you doesn’t go unheeded. 
Be loyal to me, 
and show your good will 
to have my favor; 
for Poverty is, in fact, 
the epitome of every sorrow.
I have not yet told you 
about one of her notorious sons: 
they call him Imbolare;
anyone who makes no defense against him, 
that one he leads to the gallows, 
there where his only choice 
is to climb the stairs; 
there all good things come to an end, 
and he dances to the sound of the wind 
without ever having rest. 
Now that I’ve read you the psalm, 
I believe you know it now by heart, 
so clearly I’ve explained it to you. 
If you ever wish to be a comfort to me, 
think of becoming a teacher 
of that subject I’m teaching you here: 
consider that Poverty is not your servant, 
nor will she ever serve you, 
because her service is bad, 
and the one whose clothes and shoes she removes 
can well say: “I have misfortune”; 
for she takes from him every good thing 
and reduces him to such a state 
that it’s painful to see him. 
And his friends and relatives 
do not come around him: 
they all turn their backs on him 
and go away . . . .”
. . .for the fact that Love has enslaved me 
or that Reason, whom I love little, 
considers me to be foolish 
I will never, God willing, nibble 
at whatever hook he may present. 
Love has armed me with a skewer
which he requires me to wield 
if I wish to go in his company. 
And he says that if I use any crossbow 
other than his, 
or if I give heed to any 
of Reason’s speeches 
with which she provides explanations or exhortations, 
or if I put riches 
in my purse to keep them safe, 
or if I plan to safeguard 
what I have gained - and not from him - 
then I should not count on him. 
But he cuts me off 
and says that in his company 
I’ll never play a part, 
not for any lira or any soldo
that I may ever give him. 
Love desires these gifts: 
body and wealth and soul; 
and he forms a single soul with the one 
who gives him these things confidently 
(and whoever says otherwise lies), 
and Love desires that he alone, as a precious object, 
be put by this one in his treasury. 
And whoever is captured by Love, 
Love wants him to be taught 
every beautiful custom 
that enhances his beauty. 
If one pays him appropriately, 
so is he properly paid in return. 
He wants one to be without pride, 
because he has pledged 
not to love you very long, 
if you don’t keep away from pride: 
for he sins greatly 
who commits the sin of pride.
You must be courteous 
and loyal and valiant, 
and you must give and return his greeting graciously.
If you do all of these things, 
you’ll be in Love’s favor, 
and he will compensate you well. 
And if you’re strong and skillful 
be advised when on horseback 
to use your spurs elegantly, 
so that the people 
may look at you with delight. 
In the morning you must not find yourself 
asleep on some street corner. 
If you know some songs, 
let the singing of them not weigh on you 
as much as a cantare,
so that your loved one 
may hear its melody. 
If you know how to handle a lance, 
take it and throw it, 
then run and jump and dance: 
all these things make people glad: 
by doing what they like to see, 
you make them feel special. 
Wear the most lovely clothing you can 
within your means, 
fresh and new garments, 
so that your loved one may hear about it, 
the one you hold more precious 
than the Sultan holds Cairo. 
And if they’re made of wool, 
it should not be difficult 
to design the decorations, 
if you have someone to cut them out. 
You must always wear 
brand new shoes and pants.
Keep your appearance elegant, 
and let no evil things 
be heard from your mouth, 
but esteem and give praise to everyone. 
Serve and honor women, 
for whoever sets his mind to do it 
will receive much honor. 
And if the devil tempts someone 
to speak badly about women, 
tell him to be quiet. 
Be generous, but, on the other hand, 
don’t divide your heart; 
put it all in that place, 
where you have placed it: 
for whoever has divided his heart 
is separated from Love, 
for he does not consider that one to be completely loyal 
who moves like a bishop in chess,
but he gets along only with the one 
who goes straight along his path. 
I am not yet finished with my detto, 
for you must remember 
to look for a perfect friend 
who will put heart and body 
to your service, if you need it, 
and who will be faithful and just toward you 
in your every need. 
But, by the faith I owe to San Giusto, 
true friends are 
truly hard to find. 
However, if you find a perfect friend, 
with his friendship you will be 
better off than the Prefect.
And if he has a beautiful female companion, 
may yours be more trustworthy,
because Venus gives no guarantees 
that she will not have another arrow released, 
with which love is engendered.
With them she arouses carnal passion,
more than through the chimes of dawn 
or through the service that he might give. 
She does not look him directly in the face....
