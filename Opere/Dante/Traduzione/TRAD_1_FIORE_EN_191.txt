“But any man who was astute 

or wise in worldly ways 

would never take gifts from a woman, 

for they are nothing but the snares of treachery.

For the woman who would give gifts 

would sin against her nature, 

and everyone would think her quite foolish, 

if she were not doing it to deceive.

Therefore, when giving a gift, let every woman plan 

to give in the manner that I’ve described, 

so that, when she has passed the ninth hour, 

her overcoat may be so well-lined 

that she does not have to count on the charity of anyone: 

and this depends on her having set wealth aside.”
