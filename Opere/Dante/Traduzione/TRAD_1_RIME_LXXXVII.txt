While I was seeking the gold‑ore of that quality to which nobility of heart does homage, an evil thorn, Marquis, pierced my heart, so that I'm dying from loss of blood; but I weep for what I do not find rather than because my natural life is ending: such a planet, alas, controls my destiny that I willingly remain where I am the loser.
And I'd tell you more of my suffering except that I don't want you to get great enjoyment from what is distressing to me. Of course, my lord‑who once made a spring gush forth from marble‑could, before I die, change a rocky mountain into gold.
Your sweet and clear voice makes you worthy to find any treasure, but your fickle heart, where the barb of love never made a wound, leads you away from it. I who am pierced at every pore by the thorn whose wound is treated with sighs, do nevertheless find the ore by which that power is refined through which I grow pale.
It is no fault of the sun if a blind face doesn't see him when he sets and rises, but of its evil, gross condition. If I were to see rain pour from your eyes to confirm the truth of your fine speech, you still would not put me in two minds as to my suspicion.
