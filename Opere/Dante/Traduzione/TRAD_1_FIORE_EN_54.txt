“If you cannot speak to the one you love, 

then let her know your state by letter, 

saying how Love has so bound you 

to her that you will never get enough of loving her.

And you will say to her: ‘In the name of Jesus Christ, free me 

from these thoughts that have oppressed me!’ 

But make sure that the letter is delivered 

by a messenger who will not harm your reputation.

But don’t use any names in the letter; 

for ‘her’ you will say ‘him’ and for ‘you’ ‘her’: 

Thus are pears changed into apples.

I would never use a boy as a messenger, 

for there is great danger, and here’s why: 

there’s no constancy in them; thus, they are no good.”
