First of all, Forced Abstinence 

put on a nun’s habit, 

complete with veil that she might not be recognized; 

she held a psalter in her hands and prayed.

Her face did not seem very fierce; 

indeed, it had become humble and modest; 

she had attached a rosary to her psalter, 

and it was tied with thread.

And in her hand she carried 

a thief’s staff, which Ser Deceit had given her: 

it was not made of apple wood or of oak;

her father-in-law had cut and fashioned it for her. 

Her purse was full of stolen goods.

She went towards Bad Mouth to checkmate him.
