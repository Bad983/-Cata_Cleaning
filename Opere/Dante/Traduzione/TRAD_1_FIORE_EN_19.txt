By means of Fair Appearance and Sweet Glance 

the beautiful one informed me that I should enter 

her garden and kiss the Flower, 

but that I should bring neither spear nor arrow:

for Resistance had become so cowardly 

there was no need for me to fear him; 

but nevertheless she did not want me to enter there 

unless it were very late at night.

“Since Chastity and Jealousy 

have entrusted Fear and Modesty with guarding her, 

let’s hope she doesn’t do anything foolish.

Moreover, there watches over her an uncourtly one, 

who invents a pack of lies, Bad Mouth is he, 

the one born in Normandy, who is the source of all evil.
