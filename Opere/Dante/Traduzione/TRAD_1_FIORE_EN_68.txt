When I had listened to the faithful counsel 

that Friend gave me, to the best of his ability, 

I said to him: “Friend, my wish 

was never to be disloyal.

Nor may it please God that I be led to such a point 

that I show kindness to people 

and offer them myself and my possessions, 

and then that I would think of doing harm to them.

But first of all let me challenge 

Bad Mouth and all his gang,

so that they will know where I stand.

Then I’ll find a way to put them to the sword.”

Friend answered me: “Friend, you are mistaken: 

this is not the right road.”
