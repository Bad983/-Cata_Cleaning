“Many valorous men I once deceived, 

when I had them caught in my amorous snares: 

but I myself was deceived for many months 

before most of my pleasure-giving features had faded.

I would have tricked a hundred thousand men 

and more, if I had set my snares in time, 

and counts and knights and rich merchants 

would have given me lots of gold florins.

But when I realized this, it was late, 

for I was already past my youth, 

and my sweet looks were already gone,

since old age had me in her power. 

Now, my daughter, you must take care, 

so that you will not come to the same harsh pass.”
