The Old Woman thus goes about reassuring her 

and says: “Let me take care 

of this matter; don’t be afraid, 

for I’ll know how to keep it hidden.

And should Jealousy continue to snoop around 

inside here, it would be a great disaster 

if she were to find him, but I am sure 

that her fantastications will do her little good.”

“Therefore, you can have him come, 

on condition that he behave wisely 

and that he not think to do any bold deed.”

“My darling daughter, he never went beyond good measure 

anywhere, at least that I heard about; 

in fact, people greatly praise him for his excellence.”
