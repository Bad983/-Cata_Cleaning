“Reason, you make me such a generous offer 

of your love and yourself, but I am totally 

committed to the Flower, which I will not exchange 

for another love: of this you may be certain.

Nor do I want to speak with you in unclear terms: 

if I were everything you wanted, 

then you may be sure that I would not be loyal to you, 

no matter what I would have in return, either gain or loss.

Then I would have deceived both him and you, 

and I would be a traitor for sure, 

because I swore and pledged him loyalty.

Of this matter don’t say another word, 

because the God of Love has so bound me to him 

that you I value very little and him I consider as my lord.”
