“If someone wishes to escape my fury, 

here are the weapons to defend himself from me: 

let him bring huge lampreys or enormous salmons 

or pike, without letting it be known.

A good eel is hardly bad, 

shad or tench or some good sturgeon, 

cakes or stuffed pastries or sweet breads: 

these are things that will gain my love.

Or let him send me large kids, 

or large, well-nourished capons who’ve moulted, 

or young goslings and rabbits.

After he’s served us such morsels, 

he’ll need not make any big excuses: 

let him tell me what game to play, and I’ll play it.”
