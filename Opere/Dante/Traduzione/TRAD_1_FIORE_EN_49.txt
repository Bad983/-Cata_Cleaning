I told the tale as it had happened, 

word for word, leaving nothing out, 

to my good Friend, who was not from Apulia.

After having consoled me,

he said: “Make sure you do not accept 

Reason’s advice, but keep it far removed from you, 

because Reason always troubles courtly lovers 

with that sermon she has preached to you.

But put all your desire in loving properly, 

and keep your pledge to the God of Love, 

for long suffering can conquer everything.

Now give me your full attention, 

for I will tell you the entire story 

of what a wise refined lover must do.”
