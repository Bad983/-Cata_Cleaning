When Safety saw that Boldness 

had lost everything against Fear, 

she hurried there to give him help 

and began her own combat.

But against her she could not last long: 

Fear had won that skirmish, 

and even another, if there had been one. 

But Safety was very shrewd:

she threw her sword and shield to the ground 

and immediately, with both hands, 

grabs Fear around the head.

And the others, who were all weary and without strength, 

got up and throw themselves 

into that scuffle, as though they were dogs.
