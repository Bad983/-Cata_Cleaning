“If you like, I will refrain 

from saying any more about these matters; 

but still I want to promise you 

that I will show favor to all your friends,

on condition that they be friends with me. 

If they don’t want to do it they’ll die; 

they must honor my friend,

or their situation will get much worse.

It’s quite true that I’m a traitor, 

and for some time God has judged me to be a thief, 

because I have put the world in so much error.

On many occasions I have sworn falsely, 

but I do my business without fanfare, 

so that no one has ever noticed it.”
