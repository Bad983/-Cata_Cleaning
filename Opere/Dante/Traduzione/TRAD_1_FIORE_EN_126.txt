“Those who do not provide the defensive weapons 

I’ve mentioned to you - not to mention fine wines 

or lovely pouches full of florins ­ 

will find my judgments on them very harsh.

They should not rely on the Scriptures, 

for they should know that my theologians 

and I will prove that they are Paterines, 

and I will make them feel the hot fires.

Or at least I’ll have them imprisoned, 

or give them such harsh penances 

that it would be better if they’d not been born.

In Prato and in Arezzo and in Florence 

I destroyed and exiled a great many of them:

sorrowful is he who falls under my judgment!”
