The army of the God of Love became aware 

of how these three were tormenting me, 

and recognized how weak my voice had become: 

immediately they gave orders

that each one of them prepare 

to help me save my life, 

which would be over in a short while, 

if they did not come to help me.

When the gatekeepers heard that commotion, 

immediately they vowed among themselves 

not to give her up, either by force or by negotiations.

And those outside similarly vowed 

not to leave until the battle was over, 

and they made this oath among themselves.
