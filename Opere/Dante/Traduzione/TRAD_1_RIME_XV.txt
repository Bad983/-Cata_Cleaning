Guido, I wish that you and Lapo and I could be taken by magic and placed in a boat that, whatever the wind, was carried over the sea wherever you and I chose to go, unhindered by tempest or any foul weather ‑our desire to be together in fact always increasing, living as we would in unceasing harmony.
And with this, that the good wizard should give us for company lady Vanna and lady Lagia and her who stands on number thirty, there to talk always of love; and that each of them should be happy, as I'm sure we would be.
If I still were he who was once found worthy of love­ -him whom now I only remember‑ and if my lady's looks were different, then a boat like that would please me greatly. But you who belong to Love's kingdom, there where hope of requital is born, consider how my spirit is burdened; for a ready archer has made it his target, and shoots from the bow which Love strung for him so cheerfully that he appears entirely joyful. And now hear the strange thing my spirit desires ‑stricken, it forgives him, while seeing itself undone by him!
