“And so I go through the world preaching

and giving the appearance of leading an honest life; 

everything I do, I want to do perfectly, 

and I try to screw up what others are doing.

But whoever would look at this matter, 

if he had enough salt in his brain, 

should be able to see things the way they are, 

but I would not advise him to go around talking about it.

For the one who says things that displease either me 

or those who follow my banner, 

must either be killed or exiled,

without ever gaining our forgiveness, 

either through grace or through his actions: 

he must certainly go to his destruction.”
