“Still it’s better that you know some rules 

in order to govern both yourself and your friend: 

nourish her with tender morsels, 

and always give her the best part.

And if she wants to go somewhere, 

tell her: ‘Go, and may God bless you.’

Don’t waste your time in reprimanding her, 

unless you want to end the relationship.

And if you discover her making love, 

don’t let on that you saw her, 

and go off somewhere else.

And if she were to receive a love letter, 

don’t bother to go ask her 

who brought it or who is sending her greetings.”
