Ah, Violetta, you who so suddenly appeared to my eyes in Love's shadow, pity the heart that puts its trust in you and is dying of desire.

You, Violetta, in a more than human form, you kindled a fire in my mind through the beauty that I saw; and then, by the action of a fiery spirit, you quickened a hope that partly heals me when you smile at me. Ah, do not heed my trusting in this hope, but consider rather the great desire that burns me: for countless ladies, through their slowness to respond, have themselves been tormented because of their lovers' anguish.
