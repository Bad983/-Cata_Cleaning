“You’ve spoken to me about the handsome lad, 

the one in whom so much virtue is found; 

if he has this virtue, let him keep it for my sake: 

if I love him, I will love him like a brother.

But, because of the jewels he gave me, 

he should not be prevented from seeing me; 

but let him come as often as he can in secret, 

and if you like, then bring him here.

But this should be done quickly and without delay, 

since Jealousy cannot allow 

an hour to pass without checking on me;

for many times she starts to go away, 

and the devil, who works in her by night, 

makes her come back immediately.”
