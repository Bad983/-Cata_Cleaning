“It’s true that there are certain people 

who go begging for food in the name of God, 

for which I say to you that, in my opinion, 

to do good for these people is a meritorious act.

Of these some are quite ignorant 

and have no concept of work, 

and there are others who do have it, but times 

are bad, and their earnings are very small.

Some are exiled noblemen, 

who are unaccustomed to working, 

living solely from their revenues.

Everyone must contribute to people such as these, 

for the alms they give are well employed, 

it is merciful to help them get by.”
