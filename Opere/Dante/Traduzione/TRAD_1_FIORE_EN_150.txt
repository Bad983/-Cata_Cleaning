“My heart was truly grieved when I saw 

that my door was in such a quiet state, 

for there used to be such a crowd around it 

that the whole neighborhood would complain.

But as for me, I didn’t care, 

because they liked to come around; 

and I was then so wondrously beautiful 

that the entire world seemed mine.

Now, it was inevitable that I should die of sorrow 

when I would see those young men pass by: 

each of them it seemed was mocking me.

A wrinkled old woman, they had me called 

by the one who only a short while ago 

had loved me with great carnal desire.”
