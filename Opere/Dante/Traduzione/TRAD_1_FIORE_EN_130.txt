Just like a member of a religious order 

or a man of holy life, 

False Seeming got ready and had donned for this occasion 

the habit of Albert of Agimore.

His staff was not made of sycamore 

but of great and highly polished falsity; 

his purse was full and stocked 

with treason, more than with gold or silver;

and over his shoulder he carried a volume, all by itself:

inside his shirt he had a sharp razor,

he’d had it made in Tagliagola,

and later used it to cut the slanderous 

Bad Mouth’s throat, the one who took great pleasure 

in saying evil things about everyone.
