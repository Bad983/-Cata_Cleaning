All night and all day I traveled on 

with my staff that was not tipped with iron, 

until I arrived between the two beautiful columns: 

my heart was gaining greater confidence.

Straight to the relics I came, closer and closer,

and immediately I knelt down 

to worship that lovely blessed body;

then I began to lift the covering.

And then I tried to see if I could stick my staff 

into that loophole I told you about, 

to stick it all in with a sudden thrust;

but I could not, for the entrance 

was so tight that the act ended in failure.

The first time I was truly distraught.
