“When this wretched man has been besmirched,

he won’t be thinking right; 

he’ll think you like everything about him 

so much that you have rejected every other man

and that your heart has been given completely to him; 

and he will not guard against the deceitful ways 

of the fox who rests and lies in wait,

until he’s been properly mistreated.

For very foolish is the man who thinks he can have 

any woman to be his, and his alone, 

because of the gifts he’s given her with his wealth.

Whoever wants such a woman, let him seek her in Ethiopia, 

because I’ve not yet seen one here, 

and if she’s here, then she must be carrying the heliotrope.”
