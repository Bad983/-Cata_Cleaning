“Never love a man who’s taken 

with his own beauty, nor one who likes to preen: 

I don’t want you to fall in love with such a man, 

but stay as far away from him as you can.

The man who likes himself is very foolish 

and proud: may he receive God’s fury; 

and Ptolemy says in his work

that such a man cannot have love and spiritual freedom.

Nor can he have a heart that loves nobly, 

because all that he has said to one woman, 

he will just as quickly repeat to another;

and in this way he plans to deal with every woman 

and intends only to deceive them: 

I have heard the lament of more than one.”
