“Reason, you want to keep me from loving, 

and you say that this lord of mine is harmful 

and that, according to your word, he never was 

the God of Love, but of Pain.

I would never think of departing from him, 

nor do I want to follow your advice, 

because he is my Lord and I am his 

faithful servant; thus, it’s madness to speak of such things.

For this reason it seems to me that your advice goes 

beyond the bounds of your name,

because to be without love is nothing but a burden.

If Fortune has taken away my good luck, 

she will continue to turn her wheel, 

and that is what gives me assurance.”
