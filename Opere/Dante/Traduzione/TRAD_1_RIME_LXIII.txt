O you sweet poems that go about speaking of that noble lady who brings honour to others, one is about to join you (if he has not done so already) of whom you will say: ‘He is our brother.’ I adjure you, by that Lord who makes ladies love, do not listen to him, for there is nothing friendly to truth in what he says.

But if because of his words you have set out to approach your lady, do not stop, but go to her and say: ‘Lady, the purpose of our coming is to commend to you one who is sad and who says, "Where is the desire of my eyes?"‘
