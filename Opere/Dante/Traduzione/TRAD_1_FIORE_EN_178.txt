“And if, by chance, the devil had made him wise, 

and if the lady sees that he is afraid 

to make her this loan, 

immediately let her send him a pledge:

the best dress that she has. 

She should tell him to keep it as a pledge 

for his money, and she should not let it be known 

that this act seems to bother or offend her.

And then she’ll wait for some holiday, 

Easter or the calends of May or Pentecost, 

and let her be around him all the time,

saying that she will never sleep 

at his side, if he does not lend her the money. 

In this way, she’ll surely take the dress away from him.”
