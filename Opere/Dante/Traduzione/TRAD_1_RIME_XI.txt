Lovers, weep because Love weeps; weep to hear why he weeps. Love hears ladies calling on Pity, showing bitter grief through their eyes; because brutal Death has done his cruel work in a gentle heart, destroying that which, besides honour, is praiseworthy in a gentle lady in this world.

Hear the great honour Love did her! For I saw him in his true form lamenting over the lovely dead image; and he looked often towards heaven, where the noble soul had already taken her place, that had been a lady of such charm.
