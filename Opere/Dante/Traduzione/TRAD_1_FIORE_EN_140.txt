“For sure we sawed right through 

his throat, and he lies dead in the moat. 

Not long ago we pitched him there, 

and the devil took his soul away.”

To this the Old Woman made reply: “Now our situation 

is improved, since he’s no longer with us. 

I will put my every thought to serving 

that one whom you have recommended to me.

Tell the young lad I’ll speak on his behalf 

when I see that the time is ripe, 

I’ll go all alone to get him.”

Then she leaves, and put an end to her words, 

and commended all of them to God. 

It seemed to me that things were going very well.
