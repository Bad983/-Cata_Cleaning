When Reason had ceased with her impassioned plea 

and brought her sermon to an end, 

I said to her: “Lady, you may be sure 

your lesson has had little value for me,

since I have not believed any of it, 

and I do not like it at all. 

However, if anyone would like to have such warnings, 

I would gladly pass them on to him.

For I know the whole lesson by heart, 

and I can repeat it to those people who would appreciate it, 

but for me it contains no wisdom at all.

I am determined, even if I should die from it, 

to love the Flower, and my heart is in complete agreement, 

even if death or any other harm would result from it.”
