“Tell me, False Seeming: in what way can a man 

follow God, who has sold everything 

and given it to the poor, 

and whose purse remains empty,

and who is strong and vigorous and has fleshy cheeks? 

Would it be right to allow him 

to beg in order to survive, 

just like the others whom you’ve listed for me now?”

“The answer is no; because when God ordered 

that one should give everything to the poor, and then follow Him, 

His intention was not concerned with begging for alms

- and get this opinion out of your head ­

but rather with working always toward good ends, 

for a strong man who begs weighs down his soul.”
