“And if that man would not deign to deny the fact, 

and instead will say, to make her angrier, 

that he has another woman who’s so in love 

with him that she would not exchange him for any other,

then that woman should guard against getting angry. 

In spite of this, she should feign sadness 

on the outside, but in her heart she should rejoice; 

she should rejoice even more if he were to deny it;

and she should tell him that, indeed, revenge 

will be taken only by her, 

such that she will repay him for that debt.

Then, I would go away from him; 

I would be quick to find myself another lover, 

so that I would leave him in that sorrowful state.”
