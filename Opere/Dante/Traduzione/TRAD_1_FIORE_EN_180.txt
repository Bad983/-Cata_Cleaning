“And if she’s wise, the lady, 

when she receives that lover, 

must show him that she’s afraid 

and that she greatly fears being heard,

and that she’s putting her life in danger. 

Then she must tremble all over 

and say that he cannot stay in that place: 

then let him stay until their joy is complete.

Moreover, she must be careful 

to have her lover enter through a secret passage, 

even though he could enter through the door;

for all the things obtained through hard work 

seem to be more highly valued and inspire trust.

What costs nothing is not worth anything.”
