When I heard that kind and courtly response

which the noble lady gave, I got up

and went directly to the loophole, 

for that was the straight and proper road for me.

I went there like a good pilgrim; 

I brought my gnarled staff with me 

and did not forget my money-bag,

which the good divine craftsman had hung on me.

All my tackle, all that I had with me,

I thought only of using it to touch the relics,

if I am lucky enough to steer it into port.

My staff was not tipped with iron, 

for never did I have to thrust it against stones; 

the purse was not stitched.
