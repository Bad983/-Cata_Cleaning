When the castle was thus reduced to ashes 

and the guards had run away, 

Lady Courtesy went inside

to free her daughter from that state. 

And on each side Sincerity and Mercy

accompanied her. 

Lady Courtesy said to her: “My daughter, 

my heart has been in such pain for you,

for you were imprisoned such a long time. 

May Jealousy now have a terrible fate,

since she kept you imprisoned for so long.

Resistance and Modesty with Fear 

have fled, and Ser Bad Mouth 

has his throat cut to his misfortune.”
