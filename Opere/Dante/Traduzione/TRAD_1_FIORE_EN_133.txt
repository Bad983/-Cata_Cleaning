Abstinence then began to speak, 

saying: “The highest virtue 

that the human creature can have 

is to restrain his tongue.

It seems to us that this sin 

flowers and prospers in you more than in any other; 

if you don’t let go of it, it’s certain 

that you will go to hell.

For some time ago you began a vicious rumor 

about the young man, you know this well: 

you slandered him wrongly,

for he was not planning to do what you think he was. 

You made such heavy accusations against Fair Welcome 

that she was placed there where you can see her.”
