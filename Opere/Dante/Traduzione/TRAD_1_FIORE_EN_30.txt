As soon as she had the castle supplied 

with weapons as was necessary, 

she put watchmen at every door:

these were the most trusted in her household.

And since she feared betrayal, 

she placed Resistance at the main door, 

because she knew he was a determined knight. 

At the second gate she put Reasonâ€™s daughter - 

Modesty - who provided great defense; 

the third gate was guarded by Fear, 

a lady famous for her shrewdness;

and at the fourth gate, behind the wall, 

Bad Mouth stood: his constant purpose 

was to say evil things about everyone.
