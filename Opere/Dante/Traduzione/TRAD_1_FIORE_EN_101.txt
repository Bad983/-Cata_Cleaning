“I know every language by heart; 

I have experienced the various ways of this world: 

on one occasion I become a priest, on another a friar, 

now a prince, now a knight, now a servant, now a page,

according to where I see my advantage. 

Another time I’m a prelate, and then an abbot; 

I really like those in religious orders, 

because with them I can better hide my fox-like nature.

In addition I become a hermit and pilgrim, 

clerk and lawyer and judge, 

monk and parish priest and beguine.

I become keeper of the castle and forester, 

and sometimes a youth and an old man hunched over: 

in short, I am a jack of all trades.”
