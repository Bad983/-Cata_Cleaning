“My son, you will make a pledge, 

and I will make one too: 

namely, that I will never let chastity remain 

in any woman who has common sense, 

and you should do the same with any man you like. 

And I say to you that I will go to work 

with my torch, and I’ll heat them up 

so much that each one will obey our command.”

In order to make these vows, they brought –

in the place of relics and a missal –

torches and bows and arrows; and so they swore

on these objects, declaring them to be equally valid.

All those in the army of Love were in agreement, 

for each one of them knew the Decretals.
