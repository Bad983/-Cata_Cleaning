	Love and the noble heart are one thing, as the wise man states in his poem, and the one can no more exist without the other than a rational soul without reason. Nature creates them when disposed to love â€‘Love as the lord and the heart as his mansion, wherein he lies asleep, sometimes a little and sometimes a long while.
Then beauty appears in a woman worthy of love, beauty that so pleases the eyes that in the heart is born a desire for the pleasing object; and the desire sometimes continues there long enough to rouse the spirit of Love. And a like effect is caused in a woman by a worthy man.
