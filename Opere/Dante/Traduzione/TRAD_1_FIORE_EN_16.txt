When I saw how Resistance was mollified, 

he who usually was more bitter than gall 

but whom I found much sweeter than honey, 

you should know that I considered myself as good as healed.

I passed into the garden in very subdued state 

for fear of offending that cruel one, 

and I swore to him on the holy gospels 

that, because of me, he would never be distressed.

Then he said to me: “I truly want you to come 

inside the garden, since you find it pleasant, 

provided you keep your hands far away from the Flower.

The good women have established peace 

between me and you: now make sure you keep it, 

so that you do not betray my trust.”
