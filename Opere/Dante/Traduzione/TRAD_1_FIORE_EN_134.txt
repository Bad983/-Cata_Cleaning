Upon hearing the strong reproach 

and criticism that Abstinence gave him, 

Bad Mouth got very mad and said he wanted 

them to leave his territory:

“You think you can clear Fair Welcome 

of that which the young lad was thinking of doing. 

I said it once and I’ll say it again, that she wanted 

to give him the Flower, and this was her intention.

That one did not kiss her by mistake, that’s for sure: 

for which I tell you, you fancy talkers, 

that this deed will not be hidden.

You seem to me to be two deceivers: 

get out of my house, for I’ll plainly 

tell you that I don’t want swindlers here.”
