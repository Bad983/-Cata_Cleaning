“The handsome lad for whom you were once punished, 

he is the one who sends them to you, 

and the others that he has are at your command: 

never have you seen a more refined man.

And he begs you, if you ever loved him, 

that for love of him you must wear 

this garland, and thus he puts himself 

completely in your power. You would commit a great sin,

if you were to refuse his gift. 

For I’m certain that he would despair, 

if you were in this way to discourage him completely;

for he would do as much as he could for you, 

and he would not object, even if you were to pawn it, 

and, if you were to sell it, he would similarly be pleased.”
