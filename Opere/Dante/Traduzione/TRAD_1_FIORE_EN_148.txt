“I was beautiful and young and without cares, 

but to the school of love I’d not yet 

been; but now I know by heart 

the techniques that will be related to you here.

Experience has made me so wise 

that I would not fear any teacher 

who might make me lose face in this subject, 

if only I were beautiful and young.

I have been studying this subject for so long 

that I have full knowledge of it in my heart. 

If you like, you will hear it,

but I did not obtain it without great hardship: 

much anguish and suffering I endured; 

but at least wisdom and experience have remained.”
