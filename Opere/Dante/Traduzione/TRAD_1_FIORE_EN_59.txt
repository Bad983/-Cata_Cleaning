“If the one you desire rejects you, 

you don’t lose anything because of her rejection, 

except for the words you’ve said to her: 

she’ll soon regret her rejection.

One woman in a hundred has never been seen 

(or even better, I’ll bet one in a thousand) 

who liked to make such a refusal, 

even though she may attack you at the beginning.

Make your amorous request, for at least you’ll have her favor, 

even though she may say crazy things about you, 

for you can’t do her any bigger favor.

But no one must say anything about this, 

if he fails in his quest to have her,

for afterwards she will go around raving about it.”
