“If there are many of these young wolf cubs, 

Holy Church is in bad shape, 

since her city is attacked 

by these young, newly-ordained apostles.

For I am certain, since they are her enemies, 

the Church cannot be defended; 

she will be taken without a single attack 

launched by catapults or war machines.

If God does not wish to offer a remedy for this, 

the war will soon be over, 

and everything will go to ruin:

but it seems to me that God has forgotten her, 

since He tolerates such betrayal 

by those in whose care He’s left her.”
