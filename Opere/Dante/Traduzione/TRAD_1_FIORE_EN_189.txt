“If that jealous one keeps her so locked up 

that she cannot go wherever she wants, 

she should make him believe that she is suffering 

from a case of gout, which she’s had for some time;

for this reason she must go to the baths, 

since this sickness is usually cured with hot baths. 

Then she will boil rosemary and violets 

and camomile and sage, and bathe in this solution.

And the jealous husband will say: ‘Go freely, 

and take some good companions with you’; 

but in his heart he will be very sad,

but he sees that he can not prevent her from going. 

She takes some companions with her, 

who will know her sickness well.”
