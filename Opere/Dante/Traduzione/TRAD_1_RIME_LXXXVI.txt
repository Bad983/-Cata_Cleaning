Dante, when by chance it happens that the love‑desire despairs of that hope which the eyes cause to grow from the fair seed of beauty revolved in the mind, then I say that‑if death reprieves her, and if Love controls her more than the two extremes‑the soul, left to herself and fearing nothing more now, is fully at liberty to change to another person.
And I'm led to say this by her who is mistress in all things, because of him who I feel has entered once more, alas, at my window. But before the black and the white kill me, I should like to hear from you‑who have been both inside and out‑whether my opinion is ill founded.
I have been together with Love since my ninth revolution of the sun, and I know how he curbs and spurs, and how under his sway one laughs and groans. He who urges reason or virtue against him acts like one who raises his voice in a storm, thinking so to lessen the conflict of the clouds, there where the thunder rolls.
Thus within his arena's bounds free will was never free, so that counsel looses its shafts in vain there. Love can indeed prick the flank with new spurs; and whatever the attraction may be that is now leading us, follow we must, if the other is outworn.
