Because of a garland I saw, every flower will make me sigh.

Lady, I saw you wearing a garland of sweet flowers, and over it a little angel hovering, a gentle angel of love, who said in his delicate song: ‘Whoever sees me will praise my Lord.’

When I am where my fair Fioretta may hear me, I will say that my lady wears my sighs around her head. But my lady will come crowned by Love, to increase desire.

These new little verses of mine, which have made a ballata of flowers, have taken, to adorn themselves, a garment given to another: so I pray you, lady, be gracious to whoever sings them.
