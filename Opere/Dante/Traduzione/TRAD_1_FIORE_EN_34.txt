With weeping, sighs, thoughts and affliction 

I passed the winter in that harsh place,

for the pain of Hell is laughter and play 

compared to that which I suffered that season

when Love put me in such distress 

and gave me no truce, neither little nor great: 

one moment he kept me cold as ice, another on fire: 

Love certainly kept the promise he made to me,

but not his promise of joy or nourishment! 

He should have nourished me with hope, 

at least until he pronounced his verdict.

To tell you the truth he made me fast, 

while giving me large servings of torment, 

with a piquant sauce of anguish.
