To every captive soul and gentle heart into whose sight this poem may come, that each may write back to me what he makes of it, a greeting in his lord, that is Love. Already almost a third of the hours had passed by of the time in which all the stars shine clear, when suddenly Love appeared to me in a form that is terrifying to remember.

Love seemed joyful, holding my heart in his hand, while in his arms he had my lady wrapped in a cloth, asleep. Then he awoke her and, though she was afraid, he humbly fed her with this heart which was burning. Then I saw him go away weeping.



What you saw, I think, was all nobility and all joy and all the good that man can know; since that great lord was proving his power over you, who is lord of the world of honour: for where he dwells tedium and trouble die, and he holds court in the keep of the mind; and so softly does he come during sleep that he takes men's hearts away without pain.

He took your heart away, seeing that your lady was sinking towards death; and it was because he feared this that he gave it her to eat. And when you saw him leave in sorrow, this was the moment when your sweet sleep was ending, being overcome by its contrary.
