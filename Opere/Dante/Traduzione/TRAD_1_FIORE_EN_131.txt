And so the good pilgrims, female and male, 

went on their pilgrimage; 

they headed straight for Bad Mouth, 

who very carefully guarded his gate.

Malicious and wise False Seeming 

greeted him with his head bent low, 

saying: “I am a master of theology, 

and we have come to you to obtain hospitality.”

Bad Mouth clearly recognized Seeming, 

but not that he was False; thus, he replied 

that he would give them shelter: “Come in.”

He observed Abstinence very closely, 

for he had seen her many times; 

but he did not recognize her as Forced.
