“You must not make this challenge, 

if you want to end this war well. 

Let the great lords of the land do it, 

those who can afford the army and battles!

Bad Mouth, who so torments you, 

is a traitor: whoever betrays him makes no mistake; 

whoever does not capture him with false appearances, 

puts at risk his own good game.

If you challenge or strike him, he will howl, 

for his nature is of that of a watch-dog: 

the more he’s threatened, the more he’ll bark.

Whoever wants to conquer Bad Mouth, 

will flatter him, if he’s wise, 

for certainly that is the proper road.”
