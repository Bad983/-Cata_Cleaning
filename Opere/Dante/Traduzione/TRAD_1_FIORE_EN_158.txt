“If you want to have a lover, I certainly approve 

of that handsome lad, who is so pleasing, 

who gave you the jewels as a gift 

and who has loved you for a very long time,

and I approve of your love for him. Nevertheless, I say to you 

that you should not love him too loyally, 

but make sure that you love others wisely, 

for the heart that loves only one person is not worth a fig.

I will seek out lots of other lovers for you, 

so that you’ll always be well supplied with this sort of wealth, 

and they will go around with pain and laments.

If you believe me, and if Christ gives you life, 

you will be dressed in ermine and squirrel, 

and your purse will always be full.”
