Of the great fragrance that entered my heart 

when I kissed the precious and sweet-smelling Flower, 

I am unable to speak or tell; 

but I will tell how the sea became tempestuous

because of Bad Mouth, that Norman thief,

who saw the event and awakened Jealousy 

and Chastity, for they were sleeping; 

for this reason I was again cast out of the garden.

And now I will tell you of the fortress 

Where Fair Welcome was imprisoned, 

the one that Love destroyed with his strength.

I will also tell how Resistance became hostile towards me 

and kept me in distress for a very long time, 

and how Reason returned to me.
