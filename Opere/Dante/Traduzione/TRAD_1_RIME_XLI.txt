One day Melancholy came to me and said: ‘I want to stay with you awhile’; and it seemed to me she brought Sorrow and Wrath with her as companions. And I said ‘Be off! Away with you!’ But she answered like a Greek and while she continued speaking with me, perfectly at her ease, I looked and saw Love drawing near, dressed in a new black cloak, with a hat on his head, and weeping real tears. And I said to him : ‘What's the matter, poor fellow?’ And he replied: ‘I'm troubled and sad, for our lady is dying, dear brother.’
