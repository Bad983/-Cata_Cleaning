While I was pleading my case 

to that cruel one who is so rash, 

the God of Love sent Sincerity and with her Mercy 

on a special mission to that place.

Sincerity began her speech, 

saying: “Resistance, you are most unkind 

to that young vassal who is so generous 

and valiant and brave, and certainly not vulgar.

The God of Love wants to let you know 

that you should not be so unkind to his servant, 

because whoever hinders him commits a great sin;

but allow him to go freely

into the garden – don’t chase him out! - 

and let him gaze upon the Flower that seems to him so fragrant.”
