“Friend, don’t be amazed if I am not as fat, 

or red, as I used to be, 

for the opposite of what I desire always occurs, 

so Fortune has brought me to this low state!

Sadness and worry have so conquered and exhausted me 

that it’s no wonder I’m in such pain; 

for I will run aground and destroy myself on such a reef, 

if Love does not assist me.

And this end Bad Mouth has secured for me 

when he awakened Chastity and Jealousy 

as soon as I had kissed the Flower.

Would that he had been in Normandy, 

there in his country where he was hanged, 

for indeed he delighted in saying defamatory things.”
