Venus, who was ready to attack, 

orders everyone either to surrender 

or to wait for their reward, 

which she has good and ready for them.

And so she swore to them on her own head 

that no one will be able to defend himself 

from the bodily wounds that she’ll inflict; 

and thus, she gives each and every one fair warning.

Modesty answered: “I’m not afraid of you.

Even if I were the only one in the castle, 

I would not believe that it could be destroyed by you.

Whenever you want, you can begin your efforts; 

You’ll not take the castle with threats alone, 

not you nor that one who calls himself the God of Love.”
