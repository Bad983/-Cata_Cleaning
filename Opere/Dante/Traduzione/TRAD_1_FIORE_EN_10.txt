Hearing that Reason was scolding me 

for my enslavement to the God of Love, 

for which I had become so pale, 

and only because of my thinking of him too much,

I said to her: “Reason, the pain he inflicts does not weigh 

on me, because I will soon be healed, 

for this master of mine has promised it to me”

- and that Reason was crazy if she continued to discuss it.

“For I am set only on pleasing him, 

since he gave me firm promises 

that he would put me in a high place,

if I would serve him well and faithfully.”

Therefore, I did not care about her at all, 

nor did I remember or follow her advice.
