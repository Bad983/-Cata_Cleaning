With his bow the God of Love pierced me

while I was gazing at a Flower that pleased me,

the Flower that Lady Courtesy had planted 

in the garden of Pleasure. Love came

so quickly that it seemed to me he flew, 

and said: “I have you in my power.”

Then as was his pleasure, and no desire of mine, 

he wounded me with five arrows.

The first, named Beauty, passed my eyes 

and transfixed my heart; the second, Angel-Like, 

gave me a bitter chill;

the third without doubt was Courtesy; 

the fourth, Social Grace, caused pain; 

the fifth is called Good Hope.
