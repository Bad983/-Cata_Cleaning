Lord, if you see my eyes desiring to weep because of a fresh sorrow that breaks my heart, I beg you, for the sake of her who never leaves you, that you relieve them of this desire; that is, that with your righteous hand you repay him who murders justice and then takes refuge with the great tyrant, sucking the poison which the tyrant has already poured forth in the wish that it may flood the world;

that you repay him who has cast such a chill of fear into the hearts of your faithful that all keep silence. But you, fire of love, light of heaven, raise up, clothed in your veil, this virtue which lies naked and cold; for without her there is no peace on earth.
