With much humility and patience I promised Love 

that I would suffer his pain 

and that my every limb and vein 

were prepared to do his will.

And my mind is set to serve him and him alone 

and will never cease to do so: 

“As long as I live and breathe, 

I will never depart from this promise.”

And Love then said to me: “My friend, 

your pledge is better than any written promise: 

be sure to worship me, for I am your god;

and set aside every other belief: 

do not believe Luke or Matthew, 

Mark or John.” And then he departs.
