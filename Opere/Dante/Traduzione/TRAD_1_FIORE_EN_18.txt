Venus said: “You are making a big mistake 

with that lover who loves you so much; 

I do not know any great lady in the world 

who would reject him:

for he is young, beautiful and charming, 

courteous, loyal, bold and well respected. 

Promise him a kiss and call him to you, 

for no one in the world is more discreet than he.”

Fair Welcome said: “I want him to come 

and kiss the Flower that he loves so much, 

on condition that he behave wisely;

for you should know that this does not displease me.”

Venus then said: “Now send him 

a good sign and let him know this.”
