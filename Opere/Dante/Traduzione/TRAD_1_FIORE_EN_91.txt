“As I’ve told you, in the humble and modest heart 

holy religion prospers and flourishes; 

a truly religious man is not proud, 

but always kind and mild.

To people such as these I yield, 

for the only kind of life I like 

is that of one who deceives and cheats and betrays; 

and so I stay as far away from them as I can,

for I could not associate with that kind of people; 

I can tell you, noble Lord, 

that if I were with them, I would surely have to pretend.

Therefore, I gloss for you my desire: 

I would rather let myself be hanged 

before I would stray from my purpose.”
