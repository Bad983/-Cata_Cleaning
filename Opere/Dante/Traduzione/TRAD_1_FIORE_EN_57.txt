“When you make your amorous request to a woman, 

whether she be old or young, 

married or widowed or virgin, 

your tongue must be ready

to praise her eyes and mouth and head, 

and to say that there’s no more beautiful woman on earth:

‘Would to God that I could have you in your 
, 

wherever I would like, and in my power!’

You must praise them all this way, 

for no woman is so old that she 

does not delight to hear these things,

and think herself to be more beautiful than a fairy. 

And immediately she begins to think of ways to skin 

the man who’s just given her such praise.”
