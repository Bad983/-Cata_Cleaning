May Love commend to you my loyal heart â€‘Love who gave it to you; and may Kindness, on your other side, remind you sometimes of me: for now, even before I'm far away from your goodness, already a sweet hope of returning consoles me. Ah, how short, it seems to me, will be my sojourn away from you! For memory often makes me turn to gaze at your image. And so, my gentle lady, I commend myself to you, both while on my journey and all the time I am away.
