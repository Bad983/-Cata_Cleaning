All around the castle I went looking 

to see if I could find the entrance 

that Foolish Generosity had built, 

in order to speed up what I was plotting.

Then I looked, and in the shadows 

under a pine tree, I saw a worthy lady, 

so nobly dressed and adorned 

that everyone was speaking about her.

And she was so beautiful 

that she illuminated everything around her 

with her face, so resplendent it was;

and a friend was resting there with her. 

The lady’s name was Wealth, 

but I do not know what the man’s name was.
