Dante Alighieri, esteemed as having all the wisdom that may be found in a man, a friend of yours, of modest condition, had expressed a grievance to a lady, claiming support from you. But she has so struck him with sharp-edged swords that he thinks he cannot possibly survive-the blows have already reached his heart.

Hence it is now up to you to take great revenge on her, for his sake whom she has so destroyed that no other woman will ever concern herself with him. As to her qualities, I tell you she is young and charming and bears Love himself in her eyes.



Dante, to whom you have appealed in this way, reply briefly, without much reflection your distress having so grieved me that I cannot linger over it. But I would very much like to know who it was you complained to, citing me. Perhaps a letter sent from me would heal you of all your wounds.

But if the lady is still unmarried, it seems to me she'll eventually unsay all she said. From what you have just told me I believe her to be as faultless as an angel in Paradise.
