“If I find a city or castle, 
in which a Paterin may have taken refuge, 
whether he be a or a , 
or any one else, provided he is my enemy,
whether he be a priest or a young cleric 
who has a lover, or a pleasure-seeking prelate, 
I must punish them all, 
because everyone fears me, so wicked am I.
Moreover, I punish usurers, 
and those who sell on credit with inflated prices, 
ruffians and spell-binders and pimps.
For each of them I feel great hatred; 
but however much pain you feel, you will not complain, 
so strongly do you fear my judgment.”
