The God of Love smiled when he heard 

Forced Abstinence speak in this way, 

and said: “We’ve got some big shots here! 

Tell me, False Seeming, may God help you,

if I keep you on my council, 

will I be able to trust you at all?”

“Yes, my Lord, don’t worry about a thing, 

for I don’t think of anything but loyalty.”

“Therefore, this is against your nature.”

“To be truthful, this is the truth, 

but nonetheless you are putting yourself at risk!

No matter how many bad things you do to it,

you’ll never remove a wolf from its hide, 

unless you skin it first.”
