Love, since after all I am forced to grieve for others to hear me and to show myself bereft of all resistance, grant me the skill as well as the will to lament; so that the grief that is unleashed may be carried by my words just as I feel it. You wish me to die, and I am satisfied: but who will excuse me if I cannot put into words what you make me feel? Who will believe that I am now so in the power of another? But if you do give me speech to match my pain, see to it, my Lord, that this cruel woman may not hear it from me before I die; for, were she to hear what I listen to within, pity would make her fair face less fair.

I cannot avoid her coming into my imagination any more than the thought that brings her there. My rash soul, actively working to its own harm, depicts her there with all the beauty and malice that is hers, thus giving shape to its own torment: then it gazes at her so imaged, and when it is wholly filled with the great desire that it draws from her eyes, it falls into a rage against itself for having lit the fire in which it miserably burns. What rational argument has power to curb when such a tempest whirls within me? My anguish, which cannot be confined, pours out audibly in breath from the mouth and also gives my eyes what they deserve.

The hostile image, that remains victorious and pitiless and dominates the faculty of willing, attracted to herself, makes me go to where she is in reality, as like runs towards like. Well I know that it is snow going to the sun, but I can do nothing else: I'm as a man in another's power who goes on his own two feet to the place where he is killed. When I draw near her I seem to hear words that say: ‘In a moment you will see him die !’ Then I turn to see to whom I can have recourse, but in the same moment the eyes light on me which so unjustly slay me.
