“Moreover, I engage myself in arranging marriages, 

sometimes I am a peacemaker, other times an agent; 

I become an administrator, but whoever 

has me do that, you should consider him crazy,

for from his properties I gain towers and palaces, 

or beautiful bedrooms and lovely halls, 

so that, if he has a son, little good his father’s properties 

will do him, because I sweep them all away.

And if you were to cook up a business deal 

with one of my associates, 

he’ll tell me, and I’ll make it happen;

but you don’t have to show your displeasure 

over having to pay me generously, 

for I sell my service at a very high price.”
