“This good man wanted me to renounce 

begging and to go to work, 

if I did not have the means to support myself 

without asking for more.

I would never agree to that advice: 

working is too much of an annoyance!

I prefer to keep on begging 

than to tire myself out by working.

For I cannot enjoy working, 

nor could I agree to do this, 

for I would often faint from pain.

I prefer to wear hypocrisy’s mantle, 

because it’s the wiser thing to do, 

for with it I’m able to cover up my fox-like manner.”
