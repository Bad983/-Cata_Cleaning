To the short day and the great circle of shadow I have come, alas, and to the whitening of the hills, when the grass loses its colour: and yet my desire remains evergreen, it is so rooted in the hard stone which speaks and has senses like a woman.

This young woman stays frozen like snow in shadow; for the sweet season moves her no more than stone, the season that warms the hills and turns them from white to green, covering them with flowers and grass.

When she wears on her head a garland of grass she takes every other woman from our mind; for the curling yellow and the green mingle so beautifully that Love comes to dwell in their shadow, Love who has locked me between small hills more tightly than cement locks stone.

Her beauty has more power than stone, nor can her blows be healed by grass: and I have fled over plains and hills to escape, if possible, from such a woman; but from her light I can find no shadow under mountain or wall or green bough.

I once saw her clothed in green and such that she would have imparted to stone the love I bear to her mere shadow; hence I have desired her in a fair grass field-as much in love as ever a woman was-enclosed by great hills.
