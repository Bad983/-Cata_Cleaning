The more Love strikes you with his rods, the more dispose yourself to obey him promptly; for I declare that no other advice can be given you: let him take this who will! Then when the time is ripe, with gentle poultices he will cause all harsh pain to leave you; for the suffering brought by Love is outweighed six times over by the sweetness of his joy. Therefore, let your heart pave the road along which to follow after his high majesty - f he has pierced you as much as the excellence of your poem shows. And do not turn one inch aside from his path, for he alone can give all bliss and perfectly reward his servants.
