“Thus, in order to accompany my lady-friend, 

whose name is Forced Abstinence, 

I assume other disguises at her wish, 

because she gives me pleasure and companionship.

And I make an effort for her to stay 

with me, because she’s very tolerant 

and knows how to show great compassion 

toward someone whom she would want to be in Spain. 

She becomes a mendicant and an abbess, 

a nun – regular, cloistered and lay –

and she becomes a vice-prioress and prioress.

Only God knows if she is truly spiritual! 

Sometimes she becomes a novice, sometimes a professed nun; 

but, no matter what she does, she only thinks of doing evil.”
