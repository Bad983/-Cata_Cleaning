“And if your lady becomes ill, 

make sure that she’s served well, 

and never leave her side: 

give her food that she likes;

and then you’ll say to her: ‘My soul, 

last night in my dream I held you 

in my arms, completely cured, as I hoped and prayed: 

certainly God granted me a great favor,

when he showed me such a sweet vision.’

Then say, as a wise man would, so that she may hear, 

that for her you’ll have a great ceremony performed,

or that you’ll go on a long pilgrimage, 

if Jesus Christ heals her. 

Thus, you’ll have her love and her heart.”
