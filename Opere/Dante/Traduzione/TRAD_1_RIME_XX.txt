Riding along a road the other day, and brooding over my journey which I disliked, I found Love in my path, meanly dressed like a pilgrim. In his looks he seemed downcast as though he had lost authority; and he came along pensive and sighing, with his head bowed so as not to see anyone.

Seeing me, he called me by name and said: ‘I come from far away, where your heart was, in accordance with my will; and I bring it with me to serve another beauty.’ Then, I took so much from him that he disappeared -I didn't see how.
