“Whoever wishes to get mad, let him get mad, 

because I’ll tell you about all my deeds, 

even if I should be immediately destroyed 

or unjustly killed just as the martyrs were,

or persecuted just like the good lord 

William who was a native of St. Amour.

In this way the wife of Deceit fixed his hash, 

because he was ruining all my deceptive plans.

For William was so persecuted by her, 

and only for the truth that he maintained, 

that he was banished from the realm.

Of my life he wrote a book, and he taught 

that he did not want me to go begging alms:

towards my mother he committed a grievous error!”
