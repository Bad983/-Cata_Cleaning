Where do you come from so sorrowfully? Tell me please, for courtesy's sake; for I fear it may be my lady who is the cause of your returning so sadly. Ah, gentle ladies, do not disdain to stop a while here in the street and to speak to one who is sad and longs for news of his lady â€‘painful though it may be for me to hear it, now that Love has so spurned me that every action of his is a blow aimed at me. See how worn away I am: if I get no consolation from you, ladies, my spirits will all take flight.
