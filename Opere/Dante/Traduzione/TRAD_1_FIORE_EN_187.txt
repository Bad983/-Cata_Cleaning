“When they’ll be engaged in that work, 

they should work together wisely; 

one should slow down and the other quicken the pace, 

according to what their senses tell them.

Their desire to move and pant like bellows 

should hardly seem painful to them, 

for both of them together should refine 

their pleasure; and would that it would last a year!

And if the lady does not have the supreme delight,

she should pretend in every possible way that she is about to, 

and show in her appearance that this is so:

let her squeeze him tightly and kiss him constantly; 

when the man has had his pleasure, 

she should pretend to faint.”
