Resistance replied: “Noble messengers, 

it is proper that I accede to your request 

and reason orders it, 

for you are neither vain nor proud,

but you are very noble orators.

The young man may come and go at will, 

but on condition that he not try to touch the Flower, 

because your prayers will not help him in that at all.

For this the daughter of Lady Courtesy, 

Fair Welcome, who is in charge of the Flower, 

would think my manners rude.

But let the mother of the God of Love

make a plea to Fair Welcome on his behalf, 

so that her heart may be warmed a little.”
