“This seems to me to be a great treachery,”

answered Love. “Do you not believe in Christ?”

“Not I, for the one who lives for loyalty 

will be poor and sad.

I certainly don’t want that mockery for myself; 

but I continue to accumulate wealth in any way possible, 

because no one thinks well 

of the person who’s faithful to poverty;

rather, everyone keeps him far away and chases him off. 

He has no friend or relative 

who would look him gladly in the face.

Even though I may not please Christ on this account, 

I prefer that people be obedient to me 

and not be servants to others.”
