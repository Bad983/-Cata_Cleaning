Then Modesty moved against Mercy 

and threatens her very harshly; 

and that one who feared her threat 

prepares to show her goodness,

for she knows how cruel Modesty can be. 

Modesty takes her sword in hand 

and said: “I want everyone to know 

that I will pay you back in kind.”

Then she raises her sword to strike her, 

but Delight moved to help Mercy 

and with his shield was able to cover her;

and then he turns to avenge her, 

but Modesty knew how to duel so well 

that he was unable to wound her.
