From my lady's eyes there comes a light so noble that where it appears things are seen that no one can describe, so sublime and wonderful they are. And from its rays such a fear rains down on my heart as makes me tremble and say: ‘Never will I return here.’ But then, losing all power to resist, I return to the place where I am over­come, comforting my frightened eyes which were the first to feel that great power. When I reach that place, alas, see, they are forced to close; the desire which brought them is extinguished there. Let Love then look to my state!
