When Venus heard Modesty 

speak so boldly against her, 

she quickly swore on all the gods 

that she will bring her great disgrace.

And then rudely she rebukes her, 

saying: “You slut, little would I value 

my torch, if I could not make 

you take refuge in a sewer.

You aren’t so much the daughter of Reason, 

who has always battled me with her children, 

that I won’t set your ass on fire.”

And to Fear who’s still on the other side:

“Your defense won’t be worth too much to you,

once I’ve stoked up your hot little oven.”
