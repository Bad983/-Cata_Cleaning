“In her bed she should embrace him, 

and together have their pleasure; 

but she should say over and over: ‘O wretched me! 

This is a terrible wrong I’m doing to my husband.’

And in the midst of his joy, she should introduce this difficulty, 

so that he may be afraid and uneasy: 

she must say to him that he would be killed 

without any consideration and quickly,

if it were known that he was with her: 

‘And poor wretched me, unlucky one, 

I know that I would be maligned,

and torn apart at the hands of my relatives.’

I would put him in this state of fear, 

so that she would be loved by him even more.”
