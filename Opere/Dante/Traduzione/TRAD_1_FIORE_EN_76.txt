“For God’s sake, gentle lady, and in mercy’s name,”

I said to her then, “if I have wronged you, 

please grant that I may make amends, 

for this I’ll do in good faith.

For I am sure your heart does not know 

how my own heart is afflicted; 

but when you’ve put me to the test, 

your heart will be sure of that which now it does not see.

For this reason I beg you to let me pass, 

so that I can bring down the castle 

of Jealousy, who has laid me low.”

She said to me: “You are my enemy; 

along another path you will go, for you will be exhausted 

before you knock down a single crenellation on the tower.”
