Ballata, I want you to seek out Love and go with him before my lady, so that when you have sung my excuses my Lord may expound them.

Ballata, your bearing is so courteous that even without escort you should have nothing to fear anywhere. But if you wish to go quite safely, seek out Love first; for perhaps it isn't wise to go without him, since she who is to hear you is, I believe, annoyed with me: were you not accompanied by him she might easily receive you coldly.
