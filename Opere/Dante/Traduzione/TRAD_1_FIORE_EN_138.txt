False Seeming said to the Old Woman: 

“In God’s name, noble and refined lady, 

you who were and always are merciful, 

may you take pity on the young lad!

May it please you to take a jewel 

on his behalf to that gracious 

Fair Welcome, who was hidden from him, 

on account of which his heart has been terribly distressed!

See here the combs that he sends to her, 

and these rings and these silk ribbons; 

and this noble garland, too.

His fate is completely entrusted to you. 

Each one of us gives him our blessing: 

as for your situation we will take care of that.”
