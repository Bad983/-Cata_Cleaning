“My Lady, I fear Jealousy so much 

that I would not dare to take this gift; 

for if tomorrow she would ask me: 

‘Who gave it to you?’ what would I tell her?”

“I would not conceal a good answer from you: 

if any other answer would fail you, 

you can say at least that I gave it to you, 

and I’ll tell her that this is the case.”

Then the Old Woman took the garland 

and put it on the young woman’s golden braids, 

and she did not resist too much.

And then she took the mirror and calls her, 

saying: “Come here, gentle daughter. 

Look at yourself, and see how beautiful you are!”
