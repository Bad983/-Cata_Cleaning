“Whoever has gotten fat from such alms 
should not expect a reward in paradise; 
rather, he should expect great punishment, 
unless he has special privilege.
And if someone is in this position, both the Pope 
who gave it to him and his college are fooling themselves, 
for I don’t think that they should give 
a strong and healthy man the privilege of begging.
Indeed, alms are rightly given 
to the old or the weak and disabled, 
to whom death would be great blessing;
but the alms that are consumed to the detriment of those 
who need them will cost the one who eats them dearly, 
and of this there is no doubt!”
