You know how to interpret your theme, intelligent as you are; so I will not enter into any dispute with you, but only answer as best I can your elegantly phrased question. My view ‑speaking as a friend‑ is that the gift you first mention signified true desire, proceeding from merit or beauty, a desire that seldom comes to an end.
As for the garment, be confident that this will be love, given by her whom you desire, as indeed your spirit well divined ‑I say this in view of the act that followed. The dead figure that came on the scene is the constancy that she'll now bear in her heart.
