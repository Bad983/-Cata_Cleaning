All that befalls me when I set out to see you, fair joy, vanishes from memory; but, when I draw close to you I hear Love saying: ‘If you would not perish, fly !’ My face shows the colour of my heart which, swooning, seeks support wherever it can; and in the whirl of my violent trembling the stones seem to cry out: ‘Die ! Die !’

Any one who sees me then commits a sin if he does not comfort my bewildered soul, at least by showing that he is sorry for me, with the pity that your mockery kills, the pity that's born of the dead expression of my eyes that desire their death.
