“In truth I say that, for great poverty 

just as for great wealth, a soul 

goes to a state of great damnation; 

and everyone should hold this opinion,

for Solomon says in one of his books:

‘Protect me, o God, through your great mercy, 

from great wealth and from penury, 

and give me your grace only according to reason.

For the one who has great wealth forgets, 

because of his great riches, the one who created him, 

and thus he directs his soul down an evil path.

The one whom poverty keeps in sorrow, 

must be a thief or an envious person, 

or he’ll be a crook or a liar’.”
