“All women - young, old, middle-aged - 

are so naturally disposed to taking 

that no one can have their wares 

for free, so uncourtly are they:

for those who show themselves to be more charitable 

and not greedy make fun of you. 

Nature is the one who has taught them 

just as she has taught the dog to hunt.

It’s true that some are disposed to give, 

but only if they’ve first made sure 

that what they give will come back twofold.

Their jewels are not of great value, 

but they’re the bait to snare the pigeons. 

May the short-sighted ones beware!”
