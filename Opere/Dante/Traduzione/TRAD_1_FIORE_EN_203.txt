When I heard the offer she was making, 

I thought for sure the deal was done: 

thus, I decided to touch the Flower, 

which seemed to me quite ripe to pick. 

Resistance ran up to me quickly 

saying: “Get back, you disloyal rogue, 

for so help me God and St. Germain ,

I am not now the one I used to be.

The devil has brought you here again; 

if the time before you found me slow, 

you can now be sure that I have changed.

It would be better for you to be in Benevento.”

Then he took me by the collar 

and asked who was my guarantor.
