	
The belling of hounds, the cries of hunters urging them on, hares running from cover, the shouting of onlookers, swift greyhounds slipping from the leash, their veering through fair meadows, their snatching the prey ‑such things must greatly delight, I think, a heart that is free and void of love. But I, taken up with thoughts of love, find myself mocked on this account by one of them who is wont to tease me thus: O what gallantry in a gentle­man! For so rough a sport to leave the ladies and their charming ways! Then, fearing that Love may overhear, I grow ashamed and so become heavy‑hearted.
