You whose looks are lowly, with eyes downcast, showing grief, where do you come from that your colour seems to have become like pity itself? Did you see our gentle lady bathing Love with tears in her eyes? Tell me, ladies, for so my heart tells me, seeing you go by with a bearing quite ennobled.

And if you do come from such grief, please stay here awhile with me, and do not hide from me how it fares with her. I see your eyes that have wept, and I see you return so disfigured that my heart trembles to see even only this.
