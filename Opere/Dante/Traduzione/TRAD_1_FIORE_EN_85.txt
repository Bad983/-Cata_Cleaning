Love answered: “It pleases me greatly 

that you have organized the army so well; 

but you, Wealth, since you have failed me, 

If I’m able, you’ll regret your action.

If I’m ever able to have rich men in my control, 

may I not live one more day, 

if I don’t diminish their possessions from great to small 

before they take their leave from me.

Poor men have taken me as their Lord, 

and each one has given me his heart; 

thus I must be content with such a gift.

If I were the god of riches as I am of love, 

I would be unhappy 

if I could not make them extremely rich.”
