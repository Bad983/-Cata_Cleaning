“And if the lady were aware at all 

that that sad jerk had understood 

that he had given her much too generously 

and that he might repent of his foolishness,

then she should ask him to lend her money 

and say she’ll pay him back on a specific day; 

but in my teachings this is forbidden, 

because she should never return anything to anyone.

And when another man comes to her, let her give him a sign 

that she is cruelly tormented, 

and let her say that her dress is in hock:

‘It grieves me much that people think I am so wealthy’

And that one will get her the money or the pawn, 

so that her dress may be returned to her.”
