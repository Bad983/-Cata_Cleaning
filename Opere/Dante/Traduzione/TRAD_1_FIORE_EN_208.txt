Resistance smashed the spear to smithereens, 

and then he deals a tremendous blow, 

such that the entire shield is shattered: 

Sincerity is sent crashing to the ground.

Then he strikes her many times, 

and the beautiful one so begged for mercy 

that Mercy felt great compassion for her: 

she advances towards the evil one,

and with a pointed spear she wounded him, 

and she bathed him with incessant tears, 

such that the uncourtly one surrendered,

since he thought he was drowning. 

Then, Modesty came running up, 

because Resistance was crying “Help!”
