“And when I see those naked beggars, 

trembling on mountains of manure, 

and suffering so much from the cold and hunger 

that they cannot pray either to God or the Saints,

as fast as I can, I flee from their sight, 

without comforting any of them; 

rather, I say to them: ‘I commend you to the devil, you 

and all those who have no.’

Because their physical makeup is cold and dry, 

I don’t know what I could squeeze out of them:

what can that one give who licks the knife?

I think it would be crazy for me 

to teach a fruit vendor how to sell fruit, 

or for me to look for fat in a dog’s house.”
