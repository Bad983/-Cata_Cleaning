'O company of the elect chosen to feast
at the great supper of the blessÃ¨d Lamb,
who feeds you so that your desire is ever satisfied,
'since by God's grace this man enjoys a foretaste
of whatsoever falls beneath your table,
before death sets a limit to his time,
'heed his immeasurable craving and with dewdrops
from that fountain where you drink forever,
refresh him at the very source of all his thoughts.'
Thus Beatrice.  And those joyful spirits
transformed themselves to rings around fixed poles,
circling, like blazing comets, in their brightness.
And as wheels in the movements of a clock
turn in such a way that, to an observer,
the innermost seems standing still, the outermost to fly,
just so those dancers in their circling,
moving to a different measure, fast or slow,
let me gauge their wealth of gladness.
From the dancer I made out to be most precious
I saw come forth a flame so full of joy
that not one there produced a greater brightness.
Three times it circled Beatrice,
its song so filled with heavenly delight
my phantasy cannot repeat it.
And so my pen skips and I do not write it,
for our imagination is too crude, as is our speech,
to paint the subtler colors of the folds of bliss.
'O my holy sister, who pray to us
with such devotion, by the ardor of your love
you draw me forth from that fair circle.'
Once the blessèd fire had come to rest,
for my lady it breathed forth these words,
just as here I've set them down.
And she: 'O everlasting light of that great man
with whom our Lord did leave the keys,
which He brought down from this astounding joy,
'test this man as you see fit on points,
both minor and essential, about the faith
by which you walked upon the sea.
'Whether his love is just, and just his hope and faith,
is not concealed from you because your sight
can reach the place where all things are revealed.
'But since this realm elects its citizens
by measure of true faith, it surely is his lot
to speak of it, that he may praise its glory.'
Just as the bachelor arms himself and does not speak
while the master is setting forth the question --
for discussion, not for final disposition --
so I armed myself with all my arguments
while she was speaking, readying myself
for such an examiner and such professing.
'Speak up, good Christian, and make your declaration.
What is faith?'  At that I lifted up my brow
to the light from which this breathed,
and then I faced Beatrice, who quickly signaled,
with a glance, that I should now pour forth
the waters welling from the source within me.
'May the grace that allows me to make confession
to the great centurion,' I began,
'grant clear expression to my thoughts.'
And I continued: 'As the truthful pen,
father, of your dear brother wrote it,
he who, with you, set Rome upon the path to truth,
'faith is the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things that are not seen.
And this I take to be its quiddity.'
Then I heard: 'You reason rightly if you understand
why he placed it, first, among the substances,
only then to set it down as evidence.'
And I: 'The profound mysteries
that here so richly manifest themselves to me,
to our eyes below are so concealed
'that they exist there through belief alone,
on which is based our hope to rise above.
And therefore it assumes the name of substance.
'It is from this belief that we must argue,
when there is nothing else we can examine.
And it therefore has the name of evidence.'
Then I heard: 'If all that is acquired below
from doctrine taught were this well learned,
there would be left no room for sophistry.'
This breathed forth from that kindled love.
And it continued: 'Now this coin's alloy
and weight are well examined,
'but tell me if you have it in your purse.'
And I: 'I do indeed, so bright and round
that of its coinage I am not in doubt.'
Then came forth from the depth of the light
refulgent there: 'This precious gem
upon which all the virtues rest,
'what was its origin and how did you obtain it?'
And I: 'The abundant rain of the Holy Ghost,
poured out onto the parchments old and new,
'is the syllogism that has proven it to me
with such great force that any other demonstration,
compared with it, would seem completely pointless.'
Then I heard: 'The premises, both old and new,
that you find so convincing in their truth,
why do you take them for the word of God?'
And I: 'The proof that revealed the truth to me
are the works that followed, for which nature
neither makes iron red with heat nor smites an anvil.'
'Say,' came the answer, 'who assures you that these works
all really happened?  The very thing requiring proof,
and nothing else, is your sole warrant of them.'
'For the world to have turned to Christ,'
I said, 'without miracles, that indeed was one
to outdo all others more than hundredfold.
'For poor and fasting did you come into the field
to sow the good plant that was once a vine
and now has turned into a thornbush.'
My words ended, the high and holy court resounded
through all its starry spheres with 'Lord, we praise you'
with such melody as is only sung above. 
And that nobleman who now had led me thus
from branch to branch in his examination
so that we neared the highest boughs,
began again: 'The grace that woos your mind
has until this moment opened your lips
and made your mouth say what it should,
'so that I approve what has come forth from it.
But now you must declare what you believe
and through what means you came to such belief.'
'O holy father, spirit who now can see
that which you once believed with such conviction
you outstripped younger feet to reach the sepulcher,'
I began, 'you would have me here declare
the substance of my ready faith, and also tell
the source of it, the reason why I hold it dear.
'And I reply: I believe in one God,
one and eternal, who, Himself unmoved, moves
all the heavens with His love and their desire.
'In defense of this belief I do have proof, not only
physical and metaphysical, but offered
also by the truth that pours like rain from here
'through Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms,
through what the Gospel says and what you wrote
once the burning Spirit made you holy.
'I believe in three eternal Persons.  I believe
these are a single Essence, at once threefold and one
so as to allow agreement both with "are" and "is."
'The profound truth of God's own state of which I speak
is many times imprinted in my mind
by the true instructions of the Gospel.
'This is the beginning, this the living spark
that swells into a living flame
and shines within me like a star in heaven.'
As the master to whom a servant brings good news
rejoices when he hears it, and puts his arms around
the speaker just as soon as he has finished,
thus, blessing me as he sang,
the apostolic light, at whose command I spoke,
encircled me three times once I was silent,
because my words had brought him such delight.
