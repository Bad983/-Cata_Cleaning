Words of mine that have gone about the world, you that were born when I began to write for that lady in whom I was deceived, Voi che 'ntendendo il terzo ciel movete; go now to this lady whom you know, and call on her so that she listens to your laments, saying: ‘We belong to you, but you will never see any others apart from ourselves.’

Do not stay with her, for Love is not there, but go around in clothes that show grief, like your elder sisters. When you meet a woman worthy of love, throw yourselves humbly at her feet and say: ‘It is you whom we must honour.’
