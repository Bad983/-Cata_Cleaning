When I heard the good and fine advice 

of Reason who said, without deception, that she would 

reestablish me in peace and concord 

with that one who had put me in torment,

I said to her: “Reason, of course I will comply! 

Provided that I do not have to leave my true lord;

for I am his faithful servant, and he gives me such pleasure 

that I love him more than a son loves his father.

For this reason it is unthinkable 

and unnecessary for us to talk about it, 

for this would not be easily done,

since I would be violating my pledge. 

I prefer to be an enemy of Fortune

than to worry about this.”
