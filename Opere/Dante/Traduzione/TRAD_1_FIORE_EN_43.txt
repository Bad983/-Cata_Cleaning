“Consider, my friend, if you’re acting courteously 

by refusing to love a woman 

such as myself, who am so resplendent and beautiful 

that no flaw can be found in me!

One could see his reflection in my face, 

and I am neither too fat nor too thin, 

neither too big nor too small: 

you will have great joy if you have me in your power.

For I will grant you this favor: 

I will keep you always in a prosperous state, 

and you will never have any pain in your heart.

In this matter I kept Socrates in a blessed state; 

but he, as a wise man, believed and loved me, 

for which reason he will always be remembered.”
