“Some people work at odd jobs 

but could not survive from these alone; 

thus God allows them to beg 

for that missing portion of their household needs.

Another poor man would like 

to study for the priesthood, 

and it is a meritorious act to be generous towards him 

until he is done with his studies.

And if someone would desire to learn chivalric skills 

in order to elevate himself and promote the faith, 

he would not be wrong to beg,

until he could amass a goodly sum 

and have the necessary capital with which 

to travel to the land beyond the sea.”
