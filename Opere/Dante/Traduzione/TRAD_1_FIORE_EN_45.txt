“I don’t want you to tire of listening to me: 

please try to hear and remember 

the few things I still want to say, 

for you can not learn better psalms.

You have begun to blame me 

because I wanted you to flee from Love, 

who makes people die even as they live, 

and one day this you’ll learn if you don’t free yourself from him!

If I forbid someone from drinking excessively, 

I don’t want people to hate drinking for this reason, 

except for that variety that causes harm to people.

I do not forbid you from loving, 

but I do want to stop Love from keeping you in distress, 

and, in the end, to stop you from calling yourself wretched.”
