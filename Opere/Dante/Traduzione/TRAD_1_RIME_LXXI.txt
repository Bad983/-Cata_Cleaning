Two women have come to the summit of my mind to speak of love. One is accompanied by courtesy and goodness, moral wisdom and decorum; the other has beauty and lovely charm, and fair nobility does her honour. And I -thanks to my dear Lord- I kneel at their lady-ships' feet.

Beauty and Virtue speak to my intellect, debating the question how a heart can be divided between two ladies with perfect love. The source of noble speech pronounces thus: beauty can be loved for delight and virtue for the sake of action.
