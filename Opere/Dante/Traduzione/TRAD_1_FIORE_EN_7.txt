With much rudeness he threw me out, 

that cruel, vicious and abusive Resistance did, 

so that I think I’ll not have pleasure with the Flower, 

unless Mercy and Sincerity do away with him.

But before that happens I think I’ll die, 

since my heart is in so much pain 

because of that uncouth man, who was hiding there 

and against whom I took no precaution at that crucial moment.

Now this has made me worried and fearful, 

for what I thought I had for certain 

now seems to me to be at risk.

And all this that savage one did to me! 

But I will appeal to Mercy about him, 

so that she may confront him with spear in hand.
