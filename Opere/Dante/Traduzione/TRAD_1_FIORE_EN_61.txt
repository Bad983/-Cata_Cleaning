“And if you love a constant and wise woman, 

behave wisely and constantly; 

for before she’ll say: ‘Friend, take 

my jewels,’ she’ll put you to the test many times.

And if you love a fickle woman, 

come before her in a fickle fashion, 

and behave just as she does; 

if you don’t, she’ll consider you to be a wild beast,

and believe you to be a hypocrite,

who’s come to deceive her;

for she wants someone who’s young and hardy.

A good and wise woman never speaks of this; 

indeed, she loves a determined man more than a coward, 

because she does not fear that he would bring her shame.”
