I felt a sleeping spirit of love awaken in my heart, and then I saw Love coming from far off, so joyful that I hardly knew him; and he said: ‘Now think only of doing me honour’ ‑smiling with every word he spoke. And, my Lord staying a little while with me, I looked in the direction he'd come from, and I saw my lady Vanna and my lady Bice coming towards the place where I was, the one marvel following the other; and as memory now retells it, Love said to me: ‘This one is Spring, and the other's name is Love, so much does she resemble me.’
