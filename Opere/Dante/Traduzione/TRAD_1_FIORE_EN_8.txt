If Master Argus, who built the ship 

that Jason used to seek the Golden Fleece, 

and who invented the rules and rationale for computation 

and the ten numerical signs, as everyone knows,

if he were alive, it would be difficult for him 

to calculate all the problems 

that Love gives me, without mistakes. 

Yet, for every door Love has the key,

and with this little key that I just mentioned to you 

he has placed and locked them in my heart 

in order to keep all his promises to me.

For this reason I am always ready to do his bidding; 

however, I would like for him - whenever he would like -

to ease the pain that has so conquered me.
