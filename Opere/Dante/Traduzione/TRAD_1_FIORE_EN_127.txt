“False Seeming, tell me out of courtesy, 

since I have accepted you among my barony 

and have given such a truly noble gift to you 

who are the king of fraud,

should I put my trust in you, or is it folly? 

Be sure to let me know, 

because I would be very sad tomorrow, 

if you were planning to betray me.”

“For God’s mercy, my lord, don’t be afraid, 

for I give you my word, which is just as reliable as I am, 

that I will maintain true loyalty to you.”

“Then,” said Love, “let each of you be quick 

to arm himself with his particular weapons 

and go to the castle that has ruined me.”
