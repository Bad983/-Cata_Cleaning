He perfectly sees all bliss who sees my lady among ladies the ladies who accompany her are bound to give thanks to God for this lovely grace. And her loveliness is of such power that no envy of it arises in other women; rather it makes them go with her clothed in nobility, love, and constancy.

The sight of her makes every creature humble, and it not only shows her as lovely but through her every woman is honoured. And in her bearing she is so noble that no one can call her to mind without sighing with the sweetness of love.
