Hearing that noble tale 

brought to me by those courteous messengers, 

I felt such great comfort in my heart 

that out of joy I almost lost the power of speech.

Into the garden I went in my gonella,

without any weapons, as they had commanded. 

There I found that one with the resplendent face, 

Fair Welcome, who immediately called me to her

and said: “Step forward and kiss the Flower; 

but don’t do anything that would displease me, 

because you would lose all my love.”

Thus I crossed my arms, 

and kissed the Flower with great trembling, 

so fearful was I of her menacing words.
