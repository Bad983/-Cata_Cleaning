The Old Woman went straight to my lady’s chamber, 

trotting along as fast as she could, 

and she found her in a very anxious state, 

as though she were in a foul mood.

I know she was worried, for she did not smile: 

the Old Woman quickly began to comfort her, 

saying: “My child, I suggest 

that you not fall prey to melancholy;

see what your friend has given you.”

At that point she shows her those lovely jewels 

and asks her to accept them:

“Look at how beautiful and nice they are.”

And the young woman was not slow to ask 

who it was who sends them to her.
