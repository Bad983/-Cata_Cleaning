“Moreover, let another woman of the house say to him: 

‘If my lady would want to commit an act of folly 

with a handsome man of good lineage, 

her situation would be fine and dandy,

and thus she would be the lady of a castle; 

but towards you she has such a loyal heart 

that she would not take any personal profit, 

on account of which you would be her enemy tomorrow.’

Then let the lady, although she may like 

to hear those words, say to them 

and command each of them to be silent;

she can say: ‘May God bless me, 

I already have so much of him when I have him in my arms’; 

and let her give him the finger under her cape.”
