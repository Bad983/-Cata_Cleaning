“And so they go about praising poverty, 

and they fish for riches with special nets, 

and there they put all their labor, 

although they cover themselves with a different cloak.

From them you can not expect anything certain: 

if you lend them money, it’s better just to write it off;

for if you struggle to get your money back, 

they are all intent on giving you a loss.

And each one says he’s religious, 

because he dresses in rough wool cloth, 

and keeps the soft white cloth hidden underneath.

To be sure, religion does not prosper there, 

but it prospers in the humble and pious heart 

that assumes pain and anguish as it goes through life.”
