That battle between them went on and on, 

and their clothing and bodies were torn to shreds. 

They knock each other down with brute strength. 

Such a fight had never been seen:

those inside the castle were slaughtering 

those outside. Then Love proposes a truce 

of twenty days, or more, 

whichever may be better.

For he clearly sees that he would never 

take that fortress, if his mother does not take part.

Then he sends Sincerity to summon her.

He knows that she would not say no to her; 

if Venus turns her torch against them, 

she would immediately set them all on fire.
