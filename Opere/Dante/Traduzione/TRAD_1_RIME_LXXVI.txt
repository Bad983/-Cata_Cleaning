Messer Brunetto, this young girl comes to keep Easter with you; not, you understand, an eating Easter, for she doesn't eat, she is meant to be read. Her meaning doesn't call for hasty reading, or a place that's noisy, or where players perform; in fact she'll require to be coaxed more than once before she'll enter a man's understanding.

And if you don't understand her in this way, there are many brother Alberts in your company to understand whatever's put into their hands. Get together with them, but without laughing; and if none of them are clear about the difficult bits, in the last resort go and ask Messer Giano.
