“And as soon as she has been reassured, 

she must immediately run up to him 

and say: ‘Wretched me, I can certainly 

call myself unfortunate, if I have arrived at the point

where I love, but am not loved in return! 

My reasoning becomes very rough and dull, 

when my heart is so powerfully moved 

by my great love for you.’

Then she should start her complaint once again, 

saying: ‘Your long stay away from me 

is not without reason.

I well know that you have another lover, 

whom you keep in your bedroom or in some secret place.’

And so, she will show her great sorrow over it.”
