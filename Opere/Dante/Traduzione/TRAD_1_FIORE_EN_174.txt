“Whoever has no difficulty in skinning her friend, 

as long as he has feathers left on his wing or back 

or until he is deprived of every other good 

so that he can no longer fly,

in this way she should handle the man: 

for I can say that the more she costs 

the more precious she will be held, 

and the more he will always want to love her.

Because you never value anything very highly 

except that for which you have paid: 

if it costs little, little will you value it;

and that which has cost you a lot, 

in comparison you will hold it dear, 

although you may be making a really bad deal.”
