At that point they ended their conversation. 

The Old Woman came to my house 

and said: “Will I have coat and mantle, 

if I bring you some good remedy

that will take away your sorrow?”

“Yes,” I said, “and they will be in a noble and beautiful green; 

but, you should know, they’ll have a gray 

lining and every other sort of ornament.”

I remembered that Friend told me 

that I should make a generous promise, 

but that I should delay payment as long as I can;

although I had good intentions to compensate her well, 

if for me she would unlock the door 

to release that lady from confinement.
