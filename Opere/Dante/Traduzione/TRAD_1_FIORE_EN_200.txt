Meanwhile the Old Woman leaves me, 

and had quickly passed along the path; 

and after I had waited a bit, 

I went toward the garden by the other way,

praying that God may guide me to that place 

where I would be cured of my sickness. 

I found the gate open; 

in truth, it was half-closed on purpose.

With much trepidation I went inside; 

but, when I saw Bad Mouth dead, 

I was much less fearful about my situation.

I found Love who gave me much encouragement 

with his army, and I rejoiced 

that everyone there was ready to help me.
