A lady, tender in heart and young, much graced with gentle qualities, who was by me when I was often calling on Death, seeing my eyes full of grief and hearing my wild words, began to weep violently out of fear. And other women, made aware of me by her who was weeping beside me, led her away and themselves drew near to recall me to myself. One said: ‘Sleep no more’; another ‘Why are you so distressed?’ Then I came out of the strange vision, calling on my lady's name.
