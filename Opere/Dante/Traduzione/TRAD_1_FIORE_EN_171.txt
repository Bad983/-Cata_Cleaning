“And if someone comes along who makes you promises 

and wants you to attach yourself to him with promises, 

I don’t want you to send him away for this reason, 

but tell him to give you another deadline,

since you will then be in too great a rush. 

And so I want you to kiss and embrace him, 

but be careful not to get too involved with him 

unless he unties his purse strings first.

And if someone were to send you a written note, 

make sure that you know his intention 

and that he has not written with deception in mind;

and then give him an answer, 

but not too quickly: wait a little bit, 

so that he may be in suspense for a little while.”
