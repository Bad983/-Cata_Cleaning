With the other ladies you mock at my appearance, and you don't consider, lady, the reason why my aspect seems so strange to you when I gaze at your beauty. Did you know the reason, Pity could not persist in her hard ways towards me; for when Love finds me near you he grows exultant and so assured that he strikes into my terrified spirits, killing this one and driving out that, until he alone remains to gaze at you. Hence I am changed into another's aspect ‑yet not so that I do not then per­fectly hear the wails of the outcast tormented spirits.
