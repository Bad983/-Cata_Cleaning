With a golden key Love locked my heart, 

after he had spoken to me in that way; 

but before all this he purified and prepared it well 

so that he drove out every other thought.

And then he said to me: “Just as I am your Lord,

so are you my liege man:

now be sure your heart’s not occupied 

with anything but noble and true love.

And remember to bear patiently 

the pain you will suffer because of me, 

before I give you my verdict.

For many times you’ll think you’re dying: 

one hour you’ll be happy, another sad, 

but then I’ll give you a remedy to get well.”
