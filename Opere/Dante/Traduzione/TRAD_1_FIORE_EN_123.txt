“I’m one of the servants of Antichrist, 

one of those thieves who, according to the Bible,

have a very saintly appearance, 

and each one of them is a hypocrite.

To those who see him, he seems a pious lamb, 

so mild is his external appearance; 

but inside he is a wolf by nature, 

who devours the people of Jesus Christ.

In this way we have conquered land and sea, 

and thus we give orders throughout the world: 

those who do not follow our rules, we say they stray from the faith.

With our treachery we do so much 

that everyone has declared war on us; 

but we are able to defeat them all.”
