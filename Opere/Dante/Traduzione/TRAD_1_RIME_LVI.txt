O pilgrims who go lost in thought, perhaps of some absent thing, do you come from such far ‑off people (as you show by your appearance) as not to weep as you pass through the midst of the sorrowing city, like those who seem to understand nothing of her afiction ?
If you were to tarry from a desire to hear of it, then my sighing heart tells me that you would go hence weep­ing. She has lost the one who brought her joy; and even the words one can say of her have the power to make others weep.
