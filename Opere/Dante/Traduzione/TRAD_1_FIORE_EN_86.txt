“If rich men do you harm, 

you certainly have those who will avenge you. 

Don’t worry if this does not come rapidly, 

because we’ll pay her back for her offence.

Women and young ladies with radiant faces 

will put the wealthy in such distress, 

that even the most savvy of them will be destroyed, 

provided that each woman exacts extravagant promises for herself.

But False Seeming and his friend

will not dare to take part in these matters, 

because you despise them: this displeases us.

Therefore, the assembled barony asks 

you to welcome them, and the situation will be put right.”

“Since you wish it, so it will be done.”
