“If you should play chess or backgammon 

with your lady, make sure that 

you lose and tell her that she’s the best 

thrower of dice you’ve ever seen.

And if you should play coderon, throw snake eyes, 

and make sure she’s the winner: 

don’t make a fuss over your loss, 

but handle it in a courtly manner.

Have her sit in a high place, and you down low, 

and bring her a cushion and a pillow; 

don’t ever let her see you weary of serving her.

If you should see a little speck on her, 

make sure that you brush it off, and if you should see a stone 

where she must walk, brush off the path.”
