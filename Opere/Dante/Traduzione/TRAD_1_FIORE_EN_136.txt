Ser Bad Mouth had repented 

of what he’d said or even thought, 

for he knew he’d made a mistake. 

Thus, he said to False Seeming: “It’s best that

I have your help, so that my soul may not be lost.”

And immediately he kneeled down 

and said: “I want to confess 

every sin that I have committed.”

Forced Abstinence grabbed him then, 

for she had loosened her clothes a bit, 

and False Seeming goes to work with his razor:

he cut Bad Mouth’s throat. 

And then they broke down the gate without delay: 

Generosity and Lady Courtesy passed through it.
