The Old Woman answered without delay, 

because she was an expert in good and evil: 

“You make me such a sweet request 

that I could never refuse you.

I am pleased to take and give 

these jewels in the best way 

that I can; but a wicked tongue 

that dwells within these walls makes me very fearful,

namely Bad Mouth, the slanderer, 

who every day thinks up new crimes, 

and cares not for friends or relatives.”

“Do not fear his deeds anymore, 

for we have killed that wretch 

without giving him any truce or conditions.”
