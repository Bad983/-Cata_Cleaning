When I saw the waves rise ever higher, 

because of the wind that blew from Provence,

such that masts and sails and anchors broke, 

and my good steering was to no avail,

I began to think in my heart of hearts 

that it was madness to pursue my course, 

until that bad weather passed, 

which was keeping me far from the good harbor.

Thus, I anchored myself upon a beach, 

seeing that I could not enter the harbor; 

the land seemed very inhospitable to me.

There I passed the winter in much discomfort. 

He does not know what pain is who has not experienced 

the pain of Love, because of which I almost died.
