“But when I find a very wealthy, but sick usurer, 

I frequently pay him visits, 

because I think I can take his money away, 

and not just handfuls, but bushels and bushels.

And when I do this, not a single coin remains 

for his family with which they can get fat. 

When he’s dead, I accompany him to his grave; 

then I return and am more relaxed than in January.

And if I’m blamed by anyone 

because I flee the poor and cling to the rich, 

I let it be known that the rich man has sinned more,

and for this reason I must give him comfort and advice, 

until he has divested himself of all his goods 

and given them to me, who then give him a shove into paradise.”
