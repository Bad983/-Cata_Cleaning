“I no longer care for hermitages, 

or to live in deserts and in forests, 

where storms often occur: 

thus, I leave these wild places to Saint John!

I make my humble home in cities and in castles, 

making it appear that I lead a harsh life; 

but if some tasty morsel is found in the town, 

then I must taste it for sure.

And I say how far removed I am from worldly things, 

although I amuse myself in elegant rooms and palaces; 

indeed, to tell the truth, I am completely immersed in the world.

If I can find a way to have great comforts, 

now you can be sure that I’ll not hide
