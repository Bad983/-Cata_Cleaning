Often there come to my mind the dark qualities Love gives me, and pity for myself comes over me, so that often I exclaim: ‘Alas, does this happen to anyone else?’ For Love assails me suddenly, so that life almost leaves me; only one spirit survives in me, and that remains because it speaks of you.

Then I exert myself, desiring to find some remedy, and thus pale and powerless I come to see you, thinking to be cured; but when I lift my eyes to look at you, a trembling begins in my heart which drives the soul away from my blood.
