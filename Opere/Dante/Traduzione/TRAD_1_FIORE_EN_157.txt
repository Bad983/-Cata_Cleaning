“The giving of gifts by a woman is great foolishness, 

unless they are small gifts used to lure men 

there where she thinks she can have an advantage, 

and where her gift can bring her a twofold return.

I don’t believe this activity is ignoble: 

indeed, I encourage you in this kind of giving, 

because you can only gain from it; 

it’s very wise to make this sort of business deal.

We let men perform these generous acts, 

since Nature has forbidden them to us for some time; 

thus, for a women to do this is great foolishness.

To be sure, every woman is of such nature 

that she refrains from this sort of generosity, 

unless she is desperate.”
