“And if the Lady takes your gift, 

you’ll have a good beginning for your dealings; 

but if you had obtained the promise of a kiss from her, 

you would then be sure of having the rest.

And if she does not have the courtesy to accept, 

but indeed has totally refused you, 

pretend that you are very upset, 

and leave her without saying anything.

And then don’t speak to her for a while, 

and don’t go to those places where she might be, 

and pretend you don’t know how you’ll manage.

She will then become so sad 

that she will no longer have any meat on her bones; 

and thus she will repent of her folly.”
