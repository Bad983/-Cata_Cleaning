“And if she does not have a beautiful face, 

let her turn her head toward them in a noble fashion, 

thus showing them without delay 

her very beautiful golden braids.

If her hair is not blonde, let her dye it with herbs 

and eggs, and then she may go to weddings and to parties; 

and when she goes about, let her move in such a balanced way 

that her motion is not exaggerated.

And with all courtesy let her make crossbows 

of her eyes and take aim at all those who look at her, 

and let her hook as many as she can.

Let her pretend that she can’t wait 

to be completely at his command, 

but she should not be so foolish as to love anyone.”
