Well-Hidden was a very good warrior: 

he raised his sword and strikes Modesty 

with such great force that she’s completely stunned 

and almost fell to the ground.

And then he began to lecture her, 

saying: “You must not be modest 

because of me; because there’s no one from here to Bologna

who knows how to hide something better

than I, and for this I have my name.”

Modesty did not then know what to say. 

Fear shouted to her: “Cousin, what’s the matter?

Have you completely lost your boldness? 

Now I see how you overcome your cowardice, 

when you are afraid to die.”
