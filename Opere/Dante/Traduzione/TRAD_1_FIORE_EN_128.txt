They all took their weapons 

and armed themselves with great strength, 

in order to give Jealousy pain and anguish, 

if she were to resist them.

And some took a shield, others a pavis, 

swords and spears, all with a great shout; 

each one telling the God of Love 

that those guards will be dead and captured.

Now I’ll tell you how False Seeming 

behaved in that expedition 

with his friend Forced Abstinence.

They did not take any armed warriors with them, 

but as people with a penitent look, 

they went forth to accomplish their day’s task.
