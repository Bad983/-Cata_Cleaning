“First of all I don’t want you to give 

Bad Mouth any angry looks, 

but when you pass by or stop in front of him, 

show yourself to be humble and obedient.

Be generous and offer him your person and possessions, 

and let him treat you like his servant. 

In this way I want you to deceive that rascal, 

who takes pleasure in bad-mouthing everyone.

With your arm around his shoulder and with pleasant words 

you must lead your enemy to the gallows, 

where then you’ll have him hanged.

Now pay attention to what I’ve said: 

with this one you must behave like this 

until he has been led to that narrow pass.”
