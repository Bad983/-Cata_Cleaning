Bad Mouth asks the pilgrims 
of their status and condition, 
and asked them why 
they looked so discouraged and wretched.
They said: “We are masters of theology, 
and so in every region we look for 
souls who seem destined for hell, 
in order to bring them back to the proper path.
Now it seems that it has pleased the Savior 
to have brought us here to remind you 
of your great sin and to chastise you for it, 
if you wish to learn about it and to listen.”
or done, I am ready to obey.”
