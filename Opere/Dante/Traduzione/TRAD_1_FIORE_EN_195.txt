Fair Welcome began to speak 

and answered with well-chosen words: 

“My noble Lady, I thank you very much 

for having been generous to me with your art;

but the facts of love are not clear to me, 

because I know them only through fleeting words. 

Why should I be an avid procurer of money? 

I have enough to make some nice purchases.

It’s toward acquiring noble and charming ways for myself 

that I wish to apply my powers, 

so that I may be well-supplied.

When you say to me that magic powers 

cannot change the hearts of people, 

let anyone believe it who so desires, but I consider it to be folly!”
