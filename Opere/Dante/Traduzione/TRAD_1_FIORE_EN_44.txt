“That Socrates of whom I speak to you 

was a veritable fountain of happiness, 

from which all happiness has derived, 

after he was completely under my command.

Fortune never tormented him; 

he gave no heed to her ups and downs. 

He accepted her joys and troubles, 

and never did his face change expression.

On a scale he put both good and evil, 

and since he gave them equal weight, 

he had no joy or sadness.

In the name of God, please reconsider 

for your profit, and take me as your lover! 

You can affiliate with no one more noble than I.”
