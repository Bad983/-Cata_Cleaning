Jealousy replied: “I assume the responsibility 

of guarding the Flower, 

for I believe my associates are so wise 

that I have no fear that Venus will enflame them.”

To the garden she went, proud and strong, 

and, finding Fair Welcome there, 

she said to her: “You have made such a mistake 

that I consider you to be senseless and foolish.

And to you, Fear and Modesty, I say 

that whoever relies on you to guard the Flower 

I’m sure that he has not studied in Bologna.

And as for Resistance, who now does not boast at all, 

it would be better for him to be in Catalonia,

if he cannot protect that which is in his care.”
