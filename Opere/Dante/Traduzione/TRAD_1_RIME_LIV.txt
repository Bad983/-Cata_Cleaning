A gentle thought that speaks of you comes often to dwell with me, and it talks so sweetly of love as to make the heart consent to it. The soul says to the heart: ‘Who is this who comes to console our mind, and who has such strength as not to let any other thought remain with us?’

He answers her: ‘O pensive soul, this is a new spirit of love that brings its desires before me; and its life and all its power came from the eyes of that compassionate lady who was disturbed by our suffering.’
