“Don’t place your love in a poor man, 

because a poor man is worth nothing: 

from him you can have nothing but arguments 

and anguish and poverty and great pain.

They would make you give up beautiful clothing 

and often make you sleep on straw: 

don’t let yourself get trapped in that crap, 

because I would say you’ve made a big mistake.

And never love a foreigner passing through: 

because they change their inns so many times, 

they cannot have a faithful or constant heart;

their actions are nothing but tricks. 

But if they give you gifts, do not refuse them, 

and make false shows of affection for them.”
