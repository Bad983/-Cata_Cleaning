Partridge breasts, young Bicci, will truss you in Solomon's knot all right! But loins of mutton will be still worse for you, for the skin will take revenge for the flesh! So much so that you'll live a bit nearer San Simone, if you don't hurry and get away. And by now, mind, it's too late to redeem your debts by giving up guzzling.

But to be sure, I've been told you have a profession with which (if this be true) you can set yourself up again; for it's highly profitable; and it provides, for a time, that you won't fear the bills that might put you out of action but certainly, no good came of it to Stagno's sons!



Go and pay back San Gallo before you talk or joke about other people's poverty; for all its friends, this winter, have been greatly troubled about it. What's more, if you think us such beggars, why go on asking us for charity? You have filled your lap so full at the castle of Altrafonte that I've no doubt you live on what you get there.

But God keep Tana and Francesco for you, that you may find it possible to escape Belluzzo's company! You'll end up in the Pinti poorhouse. And already I seem to see you sitting at table, one of three, an Alighieri with nothing on but a doublet.
