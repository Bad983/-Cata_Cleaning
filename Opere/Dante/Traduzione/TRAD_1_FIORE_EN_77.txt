No prayer I made to Wealth 

did me any good, 

for it seemed she cared very little, 

so cruel and heartless I found her towards me.

The God of Love, who was not far from me,

looked to see how I was faring, 

and it seemed to me my manner annoyed him. 

He came to me and said: “In what way,

friend, have you kept the oath of fealty 

you made to me a year ago?” 

I said to him: “Sire, you have my pledge,

which is my heart.” – “It will be all right, 

since you have behaved with wisdom and skill, 

you will have reward for your great distress.”
