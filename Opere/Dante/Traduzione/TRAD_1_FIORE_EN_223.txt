Venus hiked her skirt up to her waist; 

she was angry in her disposition and fierce: 

she began to march toward the castle, 

and, once there, she rested for a bit.

And while she was resting, she noted, 

since she was an expert archer, 

a loophole between two pillars, 

which Nature had designed with care.

Atop the pillars was placed an image; 

it seemed to be made of fine silver, so it shone;

it was fashioned with great skill.

Underneath there was a reliquary, 

covered by a cloth in such a way 

that the reliquary was not at all visible.
