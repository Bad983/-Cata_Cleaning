Sonnet, when Meuccio has been pointed out to you greet him as soon as you see him, and run and throw yourself at his feet ‑that will show you know how to behave. And when you have been with him a little while, greet him once more‑ don't be ashamed; then proceed to your mission, but first drawing him aside, and say: ‘Meuccio, he who is very fond of you sends you some of the things he counts most precious, so as to win a way into your good heart.’ But get him to accept as a first gift these brothers of yours: and tell them to stay with him and never come back.
