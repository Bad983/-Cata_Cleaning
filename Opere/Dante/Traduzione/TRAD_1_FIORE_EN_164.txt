“I know that you will study my book, 

my daughter, when you have left me: 

if God gives you life, I’m certain 

you’ll have a school in which you’ll teach.

You have my permission to lecture from it; 

but make sure that you’re well equipped 

to retain the lesson that you’ve heard, 

and you’ll repeat it wisely.

Never stay closed up in your house: 

go to church, or better to a dance or to the square, 

these are the places you should frequent.

And make sure you give a good beating 

to that one who stops to moon over you 

and who day and night yearns to have you.”
