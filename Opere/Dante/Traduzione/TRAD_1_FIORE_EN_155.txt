“Now I’ll tell you, my noble daughter, 

since we can speak freely 

and more boldly, I must admit, 

than we were accustomed to do (this is evident).

You know well that I’m from a foreign country, 

and that I’m here to educate you: 

thus, my daughter, I beg you to prepare yourself 

to learn how to earn your board and keep.

Let me say that I don’t intend 

for you to become entangled in love’s snares because of me; 

but I want to tell you all the same

about the road I should have taken, 

and how I should have behaved 

before my beauty had faded away”
