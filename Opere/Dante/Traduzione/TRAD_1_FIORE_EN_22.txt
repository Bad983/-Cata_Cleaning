Chastity, against whom Venus wages war,
said thus to Jealousy: “In the name of God, have mercy!
If one does not attend to this matter,
I could soon suffer shame.
Modesty and Fear have abandoned me;
foolish is the one who trusts in that Resistance,
for I am certain that he does not love faithfully,
since he guarded the entrance of the garden so badly.
As a result, you are the best guardian that
I could ever find in this world.
You are well known in Lombardy and Tuscany.
In the name of God, please guard the Flower!
If the man who kissed the Flower should despoil it even slightly,
such a great misdeed can never be remedied.”
