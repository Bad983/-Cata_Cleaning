When Resistance heard that reproach, 

he knew very well that he had made a mistake. 

Thus he said: “The devil has deceived me, 

when I showed kindness to someone.

But if I can catch the one who came for the Flower, 

and if I can keep him prisoner, 

may I be hanged by my neck 

if I don’t make him die with great pain.”

Then he squints and rolls his eyes 

and became quite horrible towards me: 

he prepares to guard the Flower resolutely.

Alas! How things have changed for me! 

In such a short time my situation has so changed 

that from abbot I fell to being less than the lowest brother.
