“My daughter, whoever wants to take delight in Love 

must know his commandments. 

In truth, two of these are unpleasant: 

whoever gets tripped up by these commits great foolishness.

One commandment says that you should give your heart 

to only one person and not share it with others; 

the second requires generosity in giving gifts: 

whoever believes Love in this would make a grave mistake.

In no way, daughter, do I want you to be generous, 

nor to put your heart in only one place; 

but, if you believe me, spread it out in many places.

And if you give gifts, make sure they’re worth little; 

if he gives you Lucca, give him Barga.

In this manner you will always control the game.”
