Fear took her sword in hand 

to help Modesty, her cousin: 

she struck Well-Hidden with such hatred 

that his life was in danger.

Battles do not last long against her: 

Boldness fought against the young woman 

with a very sharp and shiny sword, 

and so he scared her very much.

But Fear rallies all the same 

and became courageous in her defense, 

and said she’d prefer to be dead

than for Boldness to take away what’s hers. 

Then she gave him such compensation on his head 

that she sent him face down on the ground.
