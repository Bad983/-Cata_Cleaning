Jealousy went to check the doors 

and found the guards alert and ready 

to ward off all attacks, 

as well as to give and to suffer death.

Bad Mouth was trying very hard 

to make me reveal all my secrets: 

he was the enemy who gave me the most trouble, 

but it was he instead who received the most harm.

All day and night to the sound of his horn 

that one kept on shouting: “Look, look!” 

And he circled all around the walls,

saying: “That one is a whore, and that one paints her face; 

that other one has a really hot oven,

and that other one casts her rash and roving eye on men.”
