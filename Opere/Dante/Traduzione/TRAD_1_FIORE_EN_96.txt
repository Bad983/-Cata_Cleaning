“The eleven thousand holy virgins 

who are resplendent before God, 

each one was clothed in a colorful dress 

on the day they were martyred:

they were not for this reason rejected by God. 

Thus, the one who says that the soul perishes 

because of colorful clothing, should not believe it, 

for they will not be any less saved because of this.

Salvation comes from a good heart; 

clothing neither gives nor takes anything away from you. 

And this every wise man must believe:

namely, that it should not be anyone’s belief 

that whoever wears unadorned clothes 

is saved, if he has not performed good deeds.”
