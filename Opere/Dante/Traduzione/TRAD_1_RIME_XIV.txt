Never can my eyes make amends to me -short of going blind- for their great fault, that they gazed at the Garisenda tower with its fine view, and ‑confound them!‑ missed her, the worthiest of those who are talked about. So I want both of them to understand that I'll never make peace with them, since they were capable of seeing without recognizing what they ought to have been aware of without seeing. So my spirits are sad at their offence and I repeat that ‑unless I change my mind‑ I myself will kill them, the dull fools !
