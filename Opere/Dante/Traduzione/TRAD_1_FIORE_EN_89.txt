“So I pass my time with those religious

- well, religious only in appearance –

those who make their face seem sad and anguished, 

in order to appear more pious to the people.

And they show themselves to be in need, 

and through begging each one reaps and profits:

therefore, I like their friendship, 

for they are all very eager to deceive.

Then they go seeking friendship 

with wealthy people and follow after them, 

because they want to eat great delicacies

and drink high quality wines. 

This is the way they practice great abstinence! 

And then they go about praising poverty to others.”
