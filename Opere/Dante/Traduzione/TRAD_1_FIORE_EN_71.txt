“That road is called Extravagance, 

and it was built by Foolish Generosity; 

Lady Wealth guards the entrance 

and lets no one pass,

if that person is not her relative or friend. 

No matter how much beauty he might have, 

or how much courtesy or wisdom or nobility, 

she would not even deign to speak with him.

If you can find a way to go along that road, 

you will quickly demolish the castle 

and free Fair Welcome from prison.

A catapult will be of no help there, 

nor will their foolish surveillance serve the guards, 

not doors or walls or the shooting of darts.”
