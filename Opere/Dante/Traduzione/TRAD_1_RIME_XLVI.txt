Love has possessed me so long and so schooled me to his sway, that whereas formerly he was harsh to me, he now dwells gently in my heart. Thus when he so deprives me of strength that my spirits seem to flee away, it is then that my frail soul feels such sweetness that my face turns pale with it; for Love assumes such power within me that he gives my spirits voice to speak as they move, and they come forth calling on my lady, to grant me greater bliss. This happens to me whenever she sees me, and it is a thing so humble it passes belief.
