Just recently Love has told me on oath that if I look at a certain gentle lady, she with the power of her wonderful look will beatify my heart. I, who know by experience how Love, once he sees that his shaft is ready to fly, takes back his promises, I'm reluctant to die, being unable to imitate the phoenix.

If I raise my eyes, at once my heart will lose, by his blow, what little life was left it by another wound it had from him. Dante, what shall I do? For Love keeps urging me on, arid on the other hand the fear unnerves me that the green may prove worse than the black.
