“As I told you, I was celebrated 

throughout the world for my beauty, 

and many fights were begun because of this, 

and many people were often wounded.

To the one who thought he had me all to himself 

I showed more harshness; 

my promises to him were not kept, 

because other men had engaged me with their pledges.

Many times my door was broken down

and battered, when I was sleeping; 

but despite this I said nothing to them,

since I had the company of another man; 

I made him believe that his sexual pleasure 

pleased me more than any other thing in the world.”
