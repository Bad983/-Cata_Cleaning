“Do you think that if someone were to dress

a wolf in the skin of a ram and then put it 

among the sheep, the wolf would not 

devour the sheep because it appeared to be a ram?

It would not desire their blood any less, 

but rather could deceive them more rapidly, 

and since the sheep would not recognize the wolf, 

if it were to go away, they would follow.

Thus, I change my appearance, 

so that I may not be recognized as a wolf, 

even though I go about devouring people.

And, thank God, I am so wise 

that I go around cheating everyone 

and yet am considered a saint and a good man.”
