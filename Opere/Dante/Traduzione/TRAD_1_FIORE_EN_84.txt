They went over the plan with the God of Love 

and told him they agreed 

that False Seeming and Forced Abstinence 

would give Bad Mouth the coup de grace.

Generosity and Lady Courtesy would make a deal 

with that one who knows the old dance well,

and Mercy and Sincerity would give problems 

to Resistance who is so fierce.

And then Delight and Well-Hidden will advance 

and deal a mighty blow to Modesty 

so that she cannot get up.

And Boldness will make fun of Fear, 

and Safety should flay her so severely 

that sheâ€™ll no longer be found there.
