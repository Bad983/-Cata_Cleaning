“Everything I do, I do with deception, 

such that Proteus, who was used 

to changing into whatever he desired to be 

did not know even a fourth of the deceptions

that I know. Never did I keep a promise, 

and no one is aware of this, 

not even the one who passes time or eats or drinks with me; 

in the end I’ll pull a dirty trick on him.

For I know how to change my appearance so well 

that I’ve never been recognized 

anywhere, even though I may have been there long;

for the one who thinks he’s seen me many times, 

with my tricks I know how to swathe his eyes, 

so that he immediately unrecognizes me.”
