As I told you, the God of Love and his army 

of nobles, with all their might, 

were ready to do whatever it took, 

both wise and foolish, to satisfy my desire.

At that point I thought I would like to see 

Sweet Glance above all else: 

immediately Love sends him to me, 

and this gave me great pleasure.

And that one showed me Fair Welcome, 

who immediately came to greet me 

and welcomed me warmly;

and then she began to thank me 

for my jewels, since she wanted 

to compensate me for that gift.
