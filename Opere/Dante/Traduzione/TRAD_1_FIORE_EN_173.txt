“You’ll welcome him most warmly and with great honor 

and say that you’ve given yourself completely to him, 

but not for anything that he may have given you, 

but only through noble and faithful love.

Say that you have refused an eminent lord, 

who would have given you much wealth:

‘But I believe that you’ve bewitched me, 

for which reason I’m caught up in this passionate error.’

Then you’ll kiss him long and hard, 

begging him to keep your love a secret, 

so that no one will ever know about it.

To anything he’ll want to do, you’ll agree silently, 

but be careful not to consent 

to any one, except for money.”
