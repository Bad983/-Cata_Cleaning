“And when you are all alone with her, 

take her in your arms and do it boldly, 

revealing then that you are strong and hard, 

and immediately trip her up.

Don’t give her respite no matter what she says: 

if she asks for mercy, let her ask in vain. 

You’ll tell her: ‘Lady, I dare 

to do this, for Love has so taken me

with you, that I can have no peace; 

therefore, you must have mercy 

on me, who have courted you so much.

For you may be sure that I love you loyally, 

and that I will never stop loving you, 

for my heart believes it can have salvation only from you’.”
