When she heard my words, Reason leaves 

without speaking to me any longer, 

for she could not find any other argument 

to free me from the snare in which Love had me.

Thus, once more I began to deal with my thoughts 

and found myself in much greater torment 

than I was in the beginning: 

no large shield could help me in this state.

And so it pleased God that Friend 

returned to me to give me his advice. 

As soon as he saw me, he drew close

and said: “Friend, I am amazed 

to see you becoming thinner and paler with each passing day: 

where is your shining, red face?”
