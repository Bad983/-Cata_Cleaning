“If I had been a true expert 

in the game of love when I was young, 

I would be richer than any young noble woman 

or lady, whom you can see today.

I was so greatly pleasing in my youth 

that the news spread everywhere 

of how gracious and noble and beautiful I was; 

but what troubles me is that I was not wise.

So now I grieve, when I look at myself 

in the mirror and see myself grown old: 

I get very angry in my heart.

To be sure, I cannot help myself in this, 

and so I frequently sigh, 

when I see my beauty abandoning me.”
