Love said to the Barons: “I’ve sent for you 

because I need your help 

until that castle is brought down, 

the one that Jealousy recently built.

Since each one of you is my sworn ally,

I ask you to act 

in such a way that the castle 

may no longer stand against me, but that it be leveled to the ground.

For I must help Durante,

since I want to keep my promise to him, 

for I have found him to be a very refined lover.

Reason tried very hard to take him away from me; 

but that one was so wise and tenacious and constant 

that Reason’s speech had no effect at all.”
