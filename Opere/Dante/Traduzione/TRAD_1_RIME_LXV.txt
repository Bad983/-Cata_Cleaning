Because you see you're so young and fair that you awake Love in the mind, your heart has become proud and hard.

Proud you have become and hard towards me, since, alas, you seek to kill me; and this I think you do in order to discover whether the power of Love leads to death. But finding me held captive more than any other, you have no thought at all for my suffering. May you too experience his power!
