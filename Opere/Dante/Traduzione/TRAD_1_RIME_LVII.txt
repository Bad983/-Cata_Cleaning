Beyond the sphere that circles widest passes the sigh that issues from my heart: a new understanding which Love, lamenting, imparts to him draws him ever upwards. When he arrives where he desires to be, he sees a lady who receives honour and who shines so that the pilgrim spirit contemplates her for her splendour.

He sees her such that when he repeats this to me I do not understand, so subtly does he speak to the sorrowing heart that makes him speak. I know he speaks of that noble one, for he often mentions Beatrice; so that I under­stand him well, my dear ladies.
