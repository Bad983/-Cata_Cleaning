“Many good male Saints have been seen to die, 

as well as many good and glorious female Saints 

who were devout and very religious, 

and wanted to wear colored clothing:

they did not for this reason stop becoming Saints. 

But they were never spiteful; 

rather, they were charitable and devout 

and suffered to become martyrs for God.

And if I wished, I would proceed to name many of them; 

but almost all the female and male Saints 

that are revered in the world today

had families and produced children;

virgins and chaste women went about wearing

colorful dresses and outer-garments and cloaks.”
