Jealousy, who was afraid 

of being cheated out of the Flower, 

had it announced throughout the countryside 

that all good masons should come to her,

because she wanted to build a prison 

where they could imprison Fair Welcome. 

She will not be left with another guardian, 

since jealousy found her guilty of malfeasance.

“Since guarding the Flower is dangerous, 

it would be a mistake to put my trust in her 

for all her marvelous beauty.”

And if Venus should come again to visit her, 

she was sure and had no doubt 

of what would happen: that she would give up the Flower.
