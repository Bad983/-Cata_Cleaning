Last All Saints' Day I saw a lovely group of ladies, and one seemed to be at their head, Love being visible at her right hand. From her eyes she cast a light that seemed like a spirit aflame. And I made so bold as to look into her face, and I saw an angel imaged there.

Kindly and gentle, she greeted with voice and gesture those who were worthy of such honour, filling each one's heart with goodness. I believe she was a high being of heaven, come down on earth for our salvation; hence every woman with her is blessed.
