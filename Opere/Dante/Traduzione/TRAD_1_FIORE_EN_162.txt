“I could give you many examples, 

but my speech would be too long. 

Each woman must be constant in her desire 

to skin men, so false and evil are they.

If I were young, I would certainly do it; 

but I no longer think this way, 

for I was born too early, 

and thus could not take revenge.

But you, my daughter, who are endowed 

with every weapon with which to wreak revenge, 

do it so that you are quite judicious in their regard

and quick to give them pain and misfortune. 

If you do this, you will have healed me of every ill 

and relieved me of all my sorrow”
