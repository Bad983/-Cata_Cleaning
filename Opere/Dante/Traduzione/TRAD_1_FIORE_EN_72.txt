“Now I’ve summarized for you the main points 

of what a wise lover should do: 

in this way he will earn their love, 

without there ever being enmity among them.

If you succeed in freeing Fair Welcome from prison, 

make sure that you keep to this path, 

or else she would never love you, 

no matter how much she might appear to do so.

And give her freedom to be able to go 

wherever she likes in the city; 

it would be wasted effort to try to keep tabs on her.

For you could more easily hold 

a live eel by the tail, even if you were in the sea, 

than you would be able to handle a wily woman.”
