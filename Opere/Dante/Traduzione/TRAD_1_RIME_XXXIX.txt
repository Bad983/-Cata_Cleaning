Ladies who show pity in your bearing, who is this who lies so prostrate? Is she the one depicted in my heart? Ah, if she is, don't keep it from me. Her appearance is indeed so changed and her face seems so lifeless, that to my thinking she does not resemble the one who makes other women appear blessed.

‘If you cannot recognize our lady, she being so overcome, that is no surprise to me, for the same happened to us. But if you look at the gentle expression of her eyes, you will know her. Don't cry any more; you are already quite worn out.’
