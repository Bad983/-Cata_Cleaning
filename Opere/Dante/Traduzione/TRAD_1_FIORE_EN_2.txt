When I felt myself so drained 

because of all the blood I’d lost 

and did not know where to find help, 

in a flash the God of Love was there

and said: “You surely know 

that you have fallen into my hands 

thanks to the arrows with which I wounded you; 

thus, you must obey me.”

And I replied: “I’m ready 

to give you my true and noble loyalty, 

greater than the assassin’s to the Veglio or Prester John’s to God.”

And then, in truth, he put his lips 

to mine and said without a pause: 

“Be loyal to me.”
