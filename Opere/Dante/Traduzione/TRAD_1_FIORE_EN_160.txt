“And when you’ll be alone with him, 

make sure you swear to him

that you’re not giving yourself to him because of his money, 

but only for the great love you have for him.

And if there were thousands, to each one you’ll say it, 

and they’ll believe you for sure, those wretched ones; 

and do it in such a way that you put the bite on all of them, 

until you have reduced them to poverty.

You must swear that you’re all theirs; 

if you commit perjury, don’t worry about it, 

for God won’t do anything but laugh.

You may be sure that it’s no sin 

to commit perjury in order to skin 

that one who’ll be deceived by you.”
