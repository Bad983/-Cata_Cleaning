Lady, that Lord you bear in your eyes in such a way that he overcomes all resistance, gives me assurance that you'll be a friend to kindness; for there where he dwells, with great beauty for company, he draws to himself all goodness, mighty principle that he is. So I give new heart to my hope, which has been so much assailed that it would by now have been destroyed but that Love gives it strength against all adversity, with the sight of himself and with the memory of the dear place and of the lovely flower which has ringed my mind with fresh colours, thanks to your great courtesy.
