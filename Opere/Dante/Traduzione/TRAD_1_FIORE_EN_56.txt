“The sailor who continues to sail 

over the sea, looking for an unknown land, 

even though he sets his course by the North star, 

still he adjusts his sails

to move away from the coast or to approach it, 

thus doing what is best for him at that moment: 

in this way he sails for months and weeks, 

until the sea becomes calm.

Whoever desires Love’s joy must act in this way, 

if he discovers his lady to be cruel: 

now he must hunt her, and now flee from her.

When he’ll see her pale and pallid, 

he’ll know she’ll think it forever 

until she’s flat on her back beneath him.”
