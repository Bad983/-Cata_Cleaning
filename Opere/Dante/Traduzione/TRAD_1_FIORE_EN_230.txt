Time and again I failed to stick it in, 

since it wouldnâ€™t fit in there in any way; 

and my moneybag that was hanging from my staff, 

I continued banging it down below,

thinking thus to ease my staff inside; 

but nothing worked for me. 

However, in the end I shook it so much 

that I finally got it to go inside:

thus I succeeded in deflowering the Flower,

and with the seed that I had carried, 

after the plowing, so came the sowing.

The seed of the Flower had descended;

I mixed the two of them together 

such that much good fruit has issued forth.
