In this way my good Friend comforted me; 

then he left without another word. 

At that point I began to be very humble 

towards Bad Mouth, my cruel enemy.

I didnâ€™t give a hoot about Resistance, 

who had a great desire to sleep; 

Modesty truly wanted to abstain 

from battling me, I tell you this for sure.

But there was Fear, the fearful one, 

who, hearing me speak, trembled all over: 

that one was not sleepy at all;

she took great care in guarding the Flower, 

and she was more zealous than the other guards, 

since she placed no trust in them at all.
