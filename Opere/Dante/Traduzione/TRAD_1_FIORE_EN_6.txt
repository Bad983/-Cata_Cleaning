Love departs with a flutter of wings, 

and in a moment he disappeared so rapidly 

that I no longer saw or heard him; 

yet still I wait for him and his assistance.

Then I moved closer and closer 

to the Flower whose fragrance bewitched me 

and for whom I had pledged my fealty to this god. 

I said: “Who keeps me from plucking it?”

And so I stretched my hand toward the Flower, 

thinking I would be able to pluck it freely.

But I saw a big uncouth man approaching

with club in hand, saying: “Now keep in mind 

that I am Resistance, and that I am the keeper 

of this garden. I’ll make you suffer.”
