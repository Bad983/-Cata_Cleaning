The colour of love and looks expressing pity never so marvellously took possession of a woman's face, at the repeated sight of gentle eyes and sorrowful tears, as they do of yours, whenever you see my sorrowing countenance before you; so that through you I recall something to mind, such that I fear my heart may break.

I cannot hold back my wasted eyes from looking at you time and again, in their desire to weep. And you increase this desire of theirs so much that they are all consumed by it; yet they cannot weep in your presence.
