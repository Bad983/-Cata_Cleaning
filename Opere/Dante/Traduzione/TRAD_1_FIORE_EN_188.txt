“If the man arranges for her to go 
to his house to sleep overnight, 
the woman must remember to make him wait a bit.
You may be sure that the man, who’ll be 
constantly watching the street, will think he’ll die 
before he sees her coming; 
for love delayed is much more satisfying.
And when she has arrived at his house, 
she should say to that one who’s so in love with her 
that for love of him she’s become very bold;
her husband is so jealous of her, 
her husband is too jealous
that she fears she’ll be beaten: 
thus, let she play well the role of the fearful one for him.”
