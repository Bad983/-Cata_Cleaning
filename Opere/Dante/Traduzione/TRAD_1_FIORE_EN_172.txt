“And when you hear his amorous request, 

don’t give yourself to him too quickly, 

but don’t give him a great refusal either: 

our amorous art neither wants nor requires this.

Send him away from you politely, 

and may his state always be uncertain, 

so that he may have both fear and hope 

until he is completely at your command.

And when he will beg you even more, 

you’ll always tell him that you’re ready 

to grant him all manner of courtesy,

and tell him that his love makes you suffer terribly; 

by so doing you chase away his fear. 

Then stay with him and give him warm welcome.”
