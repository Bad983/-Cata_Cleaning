All four of them went through the portal; 

inside the walls they found the Old Woman,

who had come down from the tower. 

When she saw them, things looked bad to her,

but nevertheless she gave no sign of it. 

Generosity and Lady Courtesy waited for her 

and said: “My Lady, without any opposition 

you can take all of our valuables,

for they are yours, completely, 

and so we offer you this opportunity, 

and, most of all, we wish to draft the proper papers.”

The Old Woman who knew the theory well, 

since she had practiced this art many times,

gave them thanks and bows to them.
