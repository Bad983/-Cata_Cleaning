“And if she should have a whole line-up 

of those who want to run her through,

the woman must be careful 

to assign each one his particular day;

because she would be betrayed, 

if one were to find the other there; 

for she would at least have to give up 

the jewelry that they brought her.

Because one must not leave them anything 

with which they could get fat,

for all the rest is lost.

Therefore, every woman must be shrewd, 

so that the poor man may remain miserable, 

and she may be wealthy and well dressed.”
