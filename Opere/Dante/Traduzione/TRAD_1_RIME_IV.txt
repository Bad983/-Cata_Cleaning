Alas, what most pains and grips me is the pain,of thank­ing you, not knowing how: there should be a wiser man in my place, one with wisdom like yours that clinches every argument. As for the pain which, you say, grips many people, it is a longing which affects you differently from them. But I desire to understand this suffering precisely, being, as I say, one who is often gripped by it.

Therefore, I beg you, wise as you are, to show reasons drawn from authorities to prove what your thesis contains, so that it shine out with more lustre. This clarification effected through discussion, we shall then establish which suffering brings the most pain, proving our conclusion, friend, by reason and experience.
