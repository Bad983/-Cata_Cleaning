In the month of January, and not in May,

it was, when I took Love to be my lord 

and placed myself completely in his power, 

and swore homage to him.

And as further assurance, I gave him my heart 

as a pledge, so that he would not worry 

that I might not be true and loyal to him 

and always hold him as my lord and master.

Then he took my heart and said: “Friend, 

I am a very exacting lord to serve; 

but truly I say unto you that the one who serves me

will never fail to win my favor, 

and I will nourish him with good hope 

until I satisfy his desire.”
