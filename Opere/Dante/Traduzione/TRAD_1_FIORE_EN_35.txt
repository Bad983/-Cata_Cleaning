While I was languishing for a long time in this way, 

and not knowing where to find assistance, 

for the stormy times I’d suffered 

had deprived me of any hope,

beautiful Reason, who was far away from me, 

then returned and said: “You may have gone too far, 

if you do not seek help from me, 

since Fortune is so cruel toward you.

But from the Lord who created me 

I have such power that I can put in a good state 

anyone who follows my advice faithfully.

As to Fortune who has tormented you, 

if you want to abandon the God of Love, 

I’ll quickly reconcile you with her.”
