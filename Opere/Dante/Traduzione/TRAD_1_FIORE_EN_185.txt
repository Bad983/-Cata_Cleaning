“If you’ve made appointments for the same hour 

with two men – and in this you’ve been very foolish – 

suppose that one of them is with you in the bedroom, 

and the other one arrives immediately afterwards,

to this second one you will say that 

your husband is still upstairs, and that he should not 

be there too much longer, but one of the following will occur: 

‘Either you or your servant, come back shortly.’

And then she should kick him out and go back upstairs,

and bring the other one out of the hiding place, 

where he has not appreciated being locked up;

and then she should take off her robe and dress, 

saying that she had to be downstairs so long 

because of her husband, who was in the cellar.”
