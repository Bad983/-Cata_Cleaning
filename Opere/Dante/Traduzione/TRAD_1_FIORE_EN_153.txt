“I would reduce them all to poverty, 

just as I have preached to you earlier, 

and the first to be stripped of wealth 

would be the one who held me most dear.

Pity would never seize me for anyone, 

for I would like to ruin each and every one of them; 

now be assured that it is not a sin 

for one to punish their vice, if one could.

But they do not fear my threats very much, 

nor do they worry over what I say, 

since I have so many wrinkles in my face.

My daughter, may God bless you, 

I don’t know who could avenge me 

except for you, for I’m too old to do it myself.”
