The Barons met together 

to decide how they would proceed, 

or which gate they would attack first. 

On this they were all in agreement,

except for Wealth, who pledged 

that she would neither trouble herself for me, 

nor would she do any harm to the castle, 

no matter how many prayers or orders

might be given, 

because I never wanted her friendship: 

it was right that I should repent for that.

Indeed, she allowed that I showed her great respect 

under the pine tree, but she still saw 

that Poverty had me in the straits.
