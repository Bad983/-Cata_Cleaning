At this point Venus waits no longer, 

since she wants to demonstrate 

to everyone that she knows what to do: 

immediately she bends her bow,

and then takes the torch and lights it. 

She released the torch with ease 

and made it fly right through the loophole,

such that the castle can no longer be defended.

Immediately the fire took hold:

everyone fled the castle;

no one defended it any more.

Resistance said: “I can’t stay here any longer.”

Modesty fled to a foreign land, 

and Fear left with great difficulty.
