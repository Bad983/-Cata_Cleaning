Turn your eyes to see who it is who draws me so that I can come no further with you; and honour him, for he is the one who brings suffering through gentle ladies. Pray to him that he may allow that power of his, which kills without wrath, to come into me; and I tell you that one understands his ways only in the degree that one sighs.

For he has come fiercely into my mind and he there depicts a lady so noble that all my strength runs to kneel at her feet: and he makes me hear a soft voice saying: ‘Will you for a mere nothing withdraw your eyes from so fair a lady?’
