“And if there’s someone who has nothing to give, 

but will want to get away with only a pledge, 

he’ll say that the next day 

he’ll bring her more than thirty or 

She must not value their pledges, 

for there’s no one who doesn’t lie to you; 

one says to another: ‘The prostitute, 

whom you know, thought she could deceive me;

she thought she could deceive me, but I deceived her!’

For this reason no woman must give herself to anyone 

unless she is paid first;

for when he’s done it, he plans to run away, 

but she remains there scorned. 

Many times I found myself in that awful state.”
