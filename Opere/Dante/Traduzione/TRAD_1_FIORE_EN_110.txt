“Moreover, Scripture does not order 
a man with a healthy body to beg for bread 
nor to live off another’s labor: 
this does not please God, nor is He responsible for it;
neither does He want rooms and buildings to be built 
for foreigners from collected alms; 
rather He wants them to be divided among those people 
whose strength and health give Him concern.
The good Justinian prohibited 
– and he had this written in the law – 
that charity be given to a healthy man
who can earn his keep and who, as you can see, 
is unwilling to do any work; 
but he requires that you punish and exile and beat him.”
