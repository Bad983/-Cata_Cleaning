“Moreover, a woman must not believe 

that any man can cast a spell on her, 

nor that she could do the same with men, if she would wish 

them to love her against their will.

Medea, who was so knowledgeable in these matters, 

could not keep her hold on Jason, 

despite the magic spells she tried on him 

to make him direct his love towards her. 

A woman should not give expensive gifts, 

to any lover, no matter how much she might prize him: 

let her give a purse, a pillow or a tablecloth,

or a very inexpensive belt, 

a cap or a nicely crafted pin case, 

or a skein of yarn if he would deem it worthy.”
