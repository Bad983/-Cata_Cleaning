False Seeming wanted to stop 

without saying any more about his activities, 

but the God of Love gave no sign 

that he was bored by these words.

Indeed, to make him happy, he said: 

“In the end it’s best for you, False Seeming, 

to tell us of your treachery, 

so that you’ll have no more to say,

for you seem to me a man of Jesus Christ, 

and you behave like a holy hermit.”

“That’s very true, but I am a hypocrite.”

“I heard you preach abstinence.”

“It’s true, but although I show a sad face, 

inside I am stuffed with tasty morsels.”
