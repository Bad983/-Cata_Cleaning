Love makes me love so constantly and he has so bound me in his will that not even for one hour could my heart leave thinking of him. I have set myself to test what Ovid prescribed as remedy for lovesickness; but so far as I'm concerned it is simply a lie: hence I resign myself to begging for pity.

And now I know it for a fact that neither strength nor skill avails against Love, neither natural wit nor any available teaching: nothing but pity and patience and loyal service; such is the way to have dealings with him. Give this, my intelligent friend, your attention and tell me whether you agree.
