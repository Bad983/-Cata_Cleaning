Upon hearing me speak, Reason departs, 

and I remembered that I had 

a loyal friend, who usually comforted me 

whenever I experienced discomfort.

I found him rather quickly 

and told him how Resistance was behaving 

towards me, and that it seemed 

he wanted nothing better than to war with me.

And that one said to me: “Friend, don’t worry, 

for it is Resistance’s custom 

to be bitter and harsh in the beginning.

Go back to him and have no fear: 

by showing humility, you will soon soften him,

no matter how cruel and pitiless he may seem.”
