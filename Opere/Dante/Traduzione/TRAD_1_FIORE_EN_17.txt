Venus, who comes to the aid of lovers, 

came to Fair Welcome with a torch, 

which she held like a lance 

to set on fire all those she meets.

If one were to describe her appearance 

and her very noble disposition, 

it would take much longer to tell 

than to tell the lives of all the Saints.

When Fair Welcome felt the heat 

of that torch which was setting her ablaze, 

immediately her heart was joined with mine;

and Venus, who was urging her to this, 

moved close to her with a powerful look 

and told her she was greatly at fault in my regard.
