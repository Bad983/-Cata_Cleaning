Young Bicci, son of I don't know who (short of asking my lady Tessa), you've stuffed so much down your gorge that you're driven to take from others. And already people who carry purses keep clear of him when he draws near, saying: ‘Scarface there is obviously a known thief.’

And there's one who lies in bed distraught for fear that he'll be caught red-handed, who has as much to do with him as Joseph with Christ. Of Bicci and his brothers I can say that, being of that clan, they know how to use their ill-gotten gains to be good kinsmen to their wives.



I know you're Alighieri's son all right-I can tell that by the fine clean vengeance you took on his behalf for the money he exchanged the other day. Even if you'd hacked someone in pieces, you needn't have been in such a hurry to make peace; but then you had filled your sack so full that two pack-horses couldn't carry it.

O a fine custom you've introduced here, let me tell you: that if someone lays about you with a stick, he's your friend and brother! I could name those who have counted on your cowardice-but bring me some millet, let's settle our account!
