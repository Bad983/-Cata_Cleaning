“And in the skinning process you must have a certain style, 

so that it may not be evident 

that everything is being done as a kind of game: 

perhaps he would change his mind.

But let her mother or the chambermaid, 

or someone else whom she could trust, 

let anyone of them ask him 

for rosaries or a girdle or a purse.

Moreover, let the chambermaid say: ‘Sir, 

this lady needs a dress, 

but she fears you so much that she dares not ask you for it.

Her shameful reluctance has already caused her much harm, 

but you should not allow it; 

she does not have anything to cover her body’.”
