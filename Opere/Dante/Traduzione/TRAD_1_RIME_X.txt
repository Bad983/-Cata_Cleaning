O you who pass by on Love's way, attend and consider whether there be any sorrow as heavy as mine: and all I ask is that you hear me patiently, and then see for your­ selves how I am the abode and key of all torments. Love ‑not on account of my slight worth but of his own perfection- placed me in a way of life so sweet and serene that often I would hear people say behind me: ‘Heavens, what has he done to deserve having a heart so glad?’
Now I have lost all the elation that love's treasure brought me, so that I am left poverty‑stricken, even to the point of being afraid to write. Hence, choosing to act like those who for shame conceal their lack of something, I outwardly show joy but in my heart I pine and weep.
