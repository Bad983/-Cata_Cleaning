Come and hear my sighs, O gentle hearts ‑as pity desires you should‑ my sighs that depart unconsoled; and were it not for them I would die of grief: for then my eyes would be in debt to me far more often than I'd wish­ -in debt, alas, to weep so for my lady as to bring relief to my heart, weeping for her.
You will hear them often calling on my gentle lady, who has gone off to the world that is worthy of her virtue; and hear them from time to time condemning this life, in the name of the sad soul that is forsaken by its bliss.
