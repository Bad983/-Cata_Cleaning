Venus threatens these two a lot, 

saying that, if they don't surrender the castle, 

then she’ll set their burners on fire, 

so that she will surely drive them out.

She said: “To a thousand devils I commend anyone 

who flees from love, even if it were my own brother!

By God, all those who put up resistance to Love

I’ll turn them into whores.

For there’s no greater joy than loving well. 

Surrender the castle to me, or truly 

I’ll have it quickly destroyed;

and then we’ll certainly take the Flower,

and have it deflowered in such a way 

that it will no longer be off limits to any one.”
