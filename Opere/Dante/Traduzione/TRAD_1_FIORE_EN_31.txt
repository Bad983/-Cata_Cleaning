Fair Welcome was put and enclosed 

inside the fortress by Jealousy, 

who charged an old woman 

to keep her always under lock and key.

Jealousy greatly feared her beauty, 

which Chastity has always defended, 

and that Lady Courtesy, who is her mother, 

might make her give away the Flower.

And so it is true that she had it planted 

there where Fair Welcome was imprisoned, 

for she knew of no other safe place.

There on top she feared no betrayal, 

for that old woman, to whom she gave it for safekeeping, 

was a descendant of Salvagnone.
