“Yet, on the other hand, a human heart 

could not imagine the great pain I feel 

all those many hours when I remember 

the wonderful kisses that have bid me farewell.

Every joy is far from me today, 

but not anger and pain and great suffering: 

these have made a vow 

that I will never leave their clutches.

Now you can see to what point I’ve come, 

and for my pain there is no other cause 

except that I was born too soon.

But you should know that I have a firm belief 

that I will be avenged by you, 

if you will learn my lesson well.”
