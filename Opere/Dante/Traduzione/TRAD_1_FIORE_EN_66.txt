“If you have found another female friend, 

or if you are trying to get one, 

and you don’t want for this reason to abandon 

the first woman whom you’ve loved for some time,

and if you’ve given a jewel to the new woman, 

tell her to be careful not to wear it 

in a place where the first woman might see 

and recognize it, for she would be cut into pieces.

Now, if the first woman were still suspicious, 

swear that she’s wrong about you, 

that you would never misbehave in her regard.

And if she can prove it, you must be quick 

to say it happened by force and treachery: 

then grab her and water her garden.”
