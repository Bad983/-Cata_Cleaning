“I cannot avenge myself in any other way 

except through teaching you my doctrine; 

for my heart foresees 

that you will do great harm

to those scoundrels who insulted me 

both night and day. 

You will bring all of them to ruin, 

if you can keep them off balance.

My daughter, if I were the age 

that you are now, you may be sure that 

I would really pay them back for their offence

and make each one of them suffer: 

indeed, no man would be so valiant or wise 

that I would not turn him into a beggar.”
