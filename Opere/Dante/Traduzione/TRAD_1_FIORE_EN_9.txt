While thinking sadly about that savage one 

who so savagely chased me from the Flower, 

I looked on my right side and saw 

Reason, who, with tranquil face,

was coming towards me. She took me by the 

hand and said: “You have become so thin! 

I believe that you have thought too much 

about that one who’ll make you work in vain:

that person is Love, to whom you’ve given loyalty. 

But if you had listened to my advice, 

you would not have gone with him to dance.

For you can be sure the one he seizes 

He’ll keep in torment and in sorrow, 

such that his face will never be red.”
