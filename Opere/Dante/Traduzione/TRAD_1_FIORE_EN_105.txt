“With tasty morsels I fill my belly, 

and, if there’s any good wine in this world, 

I must fill my gut with it; 

for I want to live in greater comfort than the King of France!

Other people’s business is a joke 

compared to mine, for I am a master of theology 

and have foreknowledge of sacred things, 

and I weigh all earthly things in my scale.

Still, I want people to recognize my privilege 

to admonish without being admonished; 

and it’s quite right, for I’m the smartest!

Beneath my cloak I always carry a drawn bow 

to do harm and injury to anyone 

who might wish to give me the slightest reprimand.”
