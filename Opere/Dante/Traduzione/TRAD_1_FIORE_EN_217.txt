Venus mounted her swift 

steed, which was good for hunting, 

and with her company she went to Mount Cicerone: 

she orders that her war chariot of pure gold

be ready in the morning. 

The pole was quickly attached to the chariot, 

and all was readied so that 

they can begin the journey whenever they want.

But she refused to have a guide horse 

pull the chariot; rather, she took 

five doves from one of her dovecotes

and had them tied to it with golden threads. 

A coachman was not needed, 

for the goddess was an expert driver.
