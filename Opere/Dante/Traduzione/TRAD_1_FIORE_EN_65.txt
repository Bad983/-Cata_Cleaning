“Above all, think about flattery, 

praising her manners and her appearance, 

and how she passes Solomon in wisdom: 

with these words I want you to describe her.

But be careful she doesn’t notice you’re pretending, 

because you would never go there in procession, 

nor would it serve you to kneel in front of her: 

therefore, be sure to disguise your flattery well.

There’s always a woman so clever 

she never believes such tales, 

because she was once deceived by them.

But these young ladies, 

whose field has never been plowed, 

will certainly believe such stories from you.”
