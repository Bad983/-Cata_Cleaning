“We still have a cruel custom: 

in truth, all of us act

against the person we hate 

by contriving to ruin his reputation;

and if, by chance, we learn 

how he may come to an exalted post, 

in secret we plan to cut him off 

and cast him off the road.

And this we do so secretly 

that he’ll not know who made him lose it 

until he has been cast out.

For if he had known it from the start, 

perhaps he would have found a way to protect himself, 

and thus I would be considered a liar.”
