First Sincerity moved 

against Resistance, who is so haughty 

and fierce and bold in his demeanor; 

but the former came very humbly.

Resistance considered the matter well, 

for he was very careful in making sure 

that Sincerity could not secretly enter 

through the gate with her companions.

Sincerity took a spear in hand; 

she dropped her guard to attack that ugly watch-dog 

and cruelly hurls her lance at him.

In his hand, Resistance held a huge club, 

and with his shield parries the blow, 

and hits her and makes her fall face down.
