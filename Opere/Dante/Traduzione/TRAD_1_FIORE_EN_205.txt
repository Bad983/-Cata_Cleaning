Then Fair Welcome was enclosed 

by these three gatekeepers behind three gates, 

and with a very strong chain 

they chained that noble one.

Then that group ran toward me 

and said: “Upon you the burden will fall.”

Then I thought for sure I’d die, 

for they were giving me a great beating.

I begged for mercy from 

Fear, Modesty, and that cruel one;

but I received none at all.

Each one was more bitter than gall towards me; 

many times I shouted to them for mercy: 

they said to me: “You’re bleating in vain.”
