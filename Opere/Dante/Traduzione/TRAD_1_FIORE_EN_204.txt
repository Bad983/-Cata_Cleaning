After hearing that uncourtly one shout, 

Modesty and Fear understood the situation 

and ran to help him, 

and Resistance is very glad.

Each one swears to God and all the Saints

that they will make me pay; 

then they began to chase me off 

and gave me scorn and much abuse.

And they said I had committed a great sin, 

since Fair Welcome had honorably 

given me herself and her possessions,

because I was planning to steal the Flower from her. 

It was right for me to be punished, 

so that I would be in pain forever.
