Thus Fair Welcome does not delay. 

As soon as she took the mirror in hand, 

she saw her humble and honest face: 

she looks at herself many times in the mirror.

The Old Woman, who had taken her under her wing, 

swears to her saying: “In the name of God the sovereign, 

never did Isolt, Tristan’s friend, 

as you are, my noble daughter. 

It’s best that you have my advice, 

so that you might not fall into a bad situation.

I’m not surprised if you don’t know a lot, 

for a young person cannot be wise, 

because the longer I live the wiser I become.”
