When I saw myself in such an exalted state,

I gave thanks to all my benefactors, 

and I love them more today than ever before, 

for they worked hard to make my pleasure possible.

I follow the commands of Love and his mother, 

and to the army of Love I proclaim 

that I will be loyal to them forever 

and will serve them and always honor my pledge.

To the good Friend and Fair Welcome

I gave thanks a thousand times and more, 

but I never gave a thought to Reason,

who thought she had taken away my joys.

But against her I used such shrewdness

that I have enjoyed and gathered them all.
