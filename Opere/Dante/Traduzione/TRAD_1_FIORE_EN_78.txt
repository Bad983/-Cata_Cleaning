Throughout the kingdom the God of Love sends 

messengers and letters to all the barons; 

some he entreats and others he commands 

that they come to him.

He will wish to make a request of them, 

a request that must be fulfilled: 

to bring down Jealousy’s castle, 

so that not one iron band remains on the door.

On the great day, everyone presented himself, 

ready to do the God of Love’s command: 

each one gave thought to the arms

to give Jealousy pain and torment. 

I will name the Barons for you 

insofar as I remember them.
