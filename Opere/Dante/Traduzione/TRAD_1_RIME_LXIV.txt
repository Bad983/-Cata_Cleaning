‘I am a young girl, lovely and marvellous, who has come to show men something of the beauty of the place whence I came.

I came from heaven and shall return there once more, to delight others with my light; and anyone who sees me and does not fall in love with me will never have understanding of love; for nothing that makes for beauty was denied me when Nature begged me of Him who chose to make me, ladies, your companion.

Every star showers its light and power into my eyes. My beauties are a marvel in this world because they came to me from on high; nor can they be known save by the knowledge of one in whom Love comes to dwell through another's beauty.’

These words can be read in the face of an angel who has appeared here: and I, who gazed intensely that I might see her, am in danger of losing my life thereby; for I received such a wound from one whom I saw in her eyes that now I am sorrowful, and from that moment I have had no peace.
