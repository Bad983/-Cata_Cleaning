“Moreover, it seems to me no work at all 

to go around the regions of the world 

seeking out every religious order; 

but in matters of religion I unfailingly

leave the fruit behind and take the straw,

for I only want my habit to be like theirs 

and to be able to preach sweet sermons: 

with these two devices the world is blinded.

And thus I go about changing both tone and verse 

and saying humble and simple words, 

but my actions are quite different from my words;

for all those who today are eating bread

could not keep me from wandering off the straight path, 

for I am more desirous of this than a dog is of fat.”
