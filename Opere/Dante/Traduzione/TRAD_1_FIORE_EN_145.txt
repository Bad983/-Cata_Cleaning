“My dear noble and well-bred daughter, 

your great joy is yet to come. 

Now it’s my time to cry and languish, 

because my joy is completely over,

and I will not find it ever again, 

for it swore to me that it would not return. 

Now I want to advise you, who must feel 

the heat of Love’s flame: you must be careful

not to do as I did; 

for which I’m sad when I remember 

that I cannot return to love’s labor. 

Therefore, I’ll tell you how things seem to me: 

if you will follow my advice, 

you’ll not lose men’s riches or their bodies.”
