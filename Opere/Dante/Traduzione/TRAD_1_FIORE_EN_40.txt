I said to her: “Reason, since Nature placed 

delight in that labor, you may be sure 

that she did not put it there 

for no reason at all, for she is not so foolish,

but in order that the human race continue; 

indeed, Nature wants man to take delight in many ways 

in order to return gladly to these encounters, 

for it’s through pleasure that his seed produces fruit.

You keep saying that I should not take my pleasure, 

but I cannot for the life of me understand 

why anyone would undertake that labor

without pleasure; thus, I am resolute in my desire. 

Don’t dissuade me from taking pleasure with the Flower! 

Then let God do what he wishes with the Flower!”
