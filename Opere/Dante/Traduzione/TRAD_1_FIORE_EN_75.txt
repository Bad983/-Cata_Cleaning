With bowed head I greeted the lady, 

and then began to ask her 

about the path that’s called Extravagance. 

She answered: “You’ll never know it from me;

and even if you were to know it, you will never enter there, 

because I forbid entrance to everyone, 

except to those who have the means to spend and spend some more. 

So if you’re smart, you’ll leave,

for you never desired my friendship, 

nor have you ever praised me in your life. 

But now I’ll take my sweet revenge:

for rest assured that just as you scorned me, 

so I’ll give you such torment and unhappiness, 

that it would be better for you to have served me.”
