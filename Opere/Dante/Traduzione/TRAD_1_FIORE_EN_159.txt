“It’s good to know a man who has money, 

provided that someone knows how to skin him; 

and it’s a good idea to go hunting with this ‘someone’

unless he values money too highly.

It appears that associating with avaricious people 

is displeasing both to God and to the world: 

don’t feed such people at a set price, 

for payments make them very sad.

But make sure they pay you in advance; 

for when he’ll be overwhelmed with desire for you, 

by the faith I put in Saint Germain,

he’ll not be able to keep anything hidden, 

no matter how wise and astute he may be, 

so desirous will he be for sex.”
