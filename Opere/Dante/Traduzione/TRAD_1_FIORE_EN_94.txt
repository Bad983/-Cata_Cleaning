As False Seeming was speaking in that way, 

Love began to address him 

and, interrupting his speech, said 

that, in his opinion, he was sinning against God.

And then he asked him if it was possible to find 

religion in lay brothers. 

That one said: “Yes, there’s no need to doubt 

that it bore more fruit there than elsewhere;

for it would be too great a sorrow 

for everyone to lose his soul, 

because he wore colorful clothing.

Neither he nor others would ever believe this: 

because religion produces fruit and flowers in every imaginable guise 

provided that one gives one’s heart wholly over to it.”
