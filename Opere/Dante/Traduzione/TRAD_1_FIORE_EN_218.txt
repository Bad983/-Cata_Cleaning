The chariot was readied in excellent fashion. 

Early in the morning Venus climbed aboard, 

and you should know that she was well equipped 

with a bow and a well-feathered torch,

and with her she brought a well-tempered fire.

In this way she left Mount Cicerone 

and went straight to her son’s army 

with her doves that pulled the chariot.

The God of Love had broken the truce,

before Venus had arrived, 

for the wait seemed to him intolerable.

Venus went straight to him 

and said: “My son, do not fear, for in no time 

we’ll have brought this fortress down.”
