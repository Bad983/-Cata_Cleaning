“My daughter, in the name of God and mercy,

have pity on that loyal lover,

who for you has suffered so many torments 

that he could not tell you, in good faith.

He believes in no other god but you,

and has been always loyal and constant in this belief. 

My daughter, now give him such a look 

that he may be certain of that which now he cannot see.”

Fair Welcome said: “I give to him 

both myself and the Flower, and all that I possess: 

may he accept all of this as a gift!

On other occasions, I had some desire to do this, 

but then I wasn’t in the position that I’m in now: 

now he can do all that he wishes.”
