If you have nothing to give, make great promises,
just as I have told you now,
pledging to them by God and all the Saints
and even on the sacrament of the mass,
that you will make each of them a great baroness,
and in the meantime you will give them florins and bisanti,
I want you to pretend to weep,
saying that you cannot live without her.
And if you should be unable to shed any tears,
make sure that you have some juice from onions
or scallions, and this will make you cry;
or dampen your eyes with saliva,
if you cannot find anything else.
And in this way I want you to deceive them all.
