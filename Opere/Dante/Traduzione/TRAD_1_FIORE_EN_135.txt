False Seeming said: “For mercy’s sake, 

I beg you, Bad Mouth, listen to me; 

for when one tells the honest truth, 

he who does not believe it is very foolish.

You may be quite sure there’s no evidence 

that the young lad bears you hatred: 

if he were to love the friendship 

of the Flower as much as you say, and loyally,

he would have killed you a long time ago, 

since you did him such a wrong. 

But he doesn’t see things that way, nor he is prepared to,

and he always shows you kindness 

and would serve you in good and in bad 

as someone who is courteous and valorous and wise.”
