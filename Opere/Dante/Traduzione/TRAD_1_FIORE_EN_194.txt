In this way that old woman preached. 

Fair Welcome was very quiet 

and listened to her most willingly, 

and her heart is greatly reassured by it.

Thus, it would be easy to close the deal, 

if Jealousy had not been there 

and the three gatekeepers who are so vigilant, 

for each one is afraid of being deceived.

None of them was very concerned 

about Bad Mouth, who was already dead, 

for whoever would love him would make a big mistake;

for day and night he never stopped 

giving Jealousy new trouble, 

and never did he utter a true word.
